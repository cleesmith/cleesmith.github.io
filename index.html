          It ends! It's time to focus on other projects and not Cellipede, as there seems to be little interest in SEO apps

            A pre-installed Python development environment in Tiny Core for use on Windows with QEMU or VirtualBox.

            This includes: python/pip, compile tools, openssh, vim/nano, and git.
            <br />
            It is a perfect way to <em>get your feet wet</em> and begin learning Linux/Python, or
            just use it to explore Cellipede.
            <br />
            You avoid wasting time and suffering through installing all of that software.

  <h3>May 1, 2015</h3>
  May is here and we're springing into summer, so some spring clean up is needed.
  <ul>
    <li>
      final ideas for Cellipede:
      <ul>
        <li>create a generic endpoint to handle any function</li>
        <li>the endpoint should behave like ruby's <b>method missing</b></li>
        <li>
          create a Cellipede api-only version just for function execution
          <br />
          with no UI, no javascript/html/css, no database
          ... this is easy due to the app's design, thank me :-)
          <br />
          ... just the function endpoints
          ... keeping it a small/fast code base (sinatra-like)
          ... and run it on Heroku
        </li>
        <li>
          use the above for other purposes than silly seo stuff, but don't
          document the new/hidden functions so the app doesn't get abused
        </li>
        <li>add code to throttle requests avoiding HTTP DOS attacks</li>
        <li>
          all of the above just happens to coincide with the new features
          that are <em>coming soon</em> to rails5's, which puts more emphasis
          on using rails as a back-end api server with Ember/whatever in front
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      strange, I didn't expect that Levin dude to be reading this journal, but
      he seems to be responding to certain words like:
      <br />
      <em>grind</em> and <em>ruby</em> and refers to my RSS example for scraping jobs on oDesk
      <br />
      ... jealous much, I have a <em>fan boy</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      he thinks rails is some evolution of ruby, when rails is just a simple framework
      <b>written in ruby</b> for creating web/api sites
    </li>
    <li>
      he doesn't realize that you can code in ruby without focusing on OO ... there are
      talkers and doers, he's just a talker
    </li>
    <li>
      who cares ... as his code speaks for itself, as well as the <em>copy/paste</em>
      techno/babble ... others will see through this nonsense, and hopefully so will he in time
      <br />
      I simply made a bad choice by following such a project, the signs were there, but I
      failed to listen to my gut.
      <br />
      Hopefully, I can find another project that's worthy of being followed
      just watch out for the over-hype, vanity, snake oil, and grandioseness ... all are bad signs.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Apr 30, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ignore the SEO apps Cellipede and pipulate as no one is interested
      <br />
      Facts:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the pipulate videos on youtube average less than 50 views each,
          most are less than 30, again there's just no interest
        </li>
        <li>pipulate should be renamed back to <b>gropey</b>, as it has really lost it's way</li>
        <li>
          the techno/jargon babble in the Levin videos has increasing become a bit crackpot,
          at this point I feel sorry for the guy, but hey it's probably fun to
          <em>play with the knobs</em> as it were
        </li>
        <li>
          as a legacy, levinux/pipulate, are definitely the wrong rabbit holes,
          but hey everyone is allowed to pick a star and go thataway
        </li>
        <li>
          the pipulate repository on github only has: watch=2, star=15, and fork=3,
          again there's just no interest in a poorly designed/implemented SEO app
        </li>
      </ul>
      Failures:
      <ul>
        <li>pipulate's current design and implementation</li>
        <li>pipulate failed at Kickstarter</li>
        <li>
          Levin failed as an independent consultant working out of a broom/mop closet,
          the closet should have been a major hint as to mental capacity
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      While I really should have noticed the implications of the above <em>facts/failures</em>
      earlier, I did not.
      <br />
      Perhaps something will come from those projects, but I don't think so!
      <br />
      Except for noticing QEMU and Tiny Core it's been a complete waste of my time.
      <br />
      After all, I was just bored with the daily grind of security apps in ruby/python, well,
      it's back to grinding ... at least that pays well.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  <h3>Apr 25, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      idea: <b>custom sheets</b>
      <br />
      pre-built sheets for more advanced analysis/results, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>multiple columns of social counts for a site</li>
        <li>page links displayed in multiple rows</li>
        <li>serps info displayed in multiple rows/columns</li>
        <li>basically, any function(s) that requires multiple cells in a sheet</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  <h3>Apr 24, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>sync the code for cellipede and cellipede_on_heroku
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

      <a href="cellipede_vs_pipulate.html">Cellipede versus pipulate</a>
      ... the facts not the hype
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  <h3>Apr 18, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>added a <b>links</b> function which crawls/scrapes a page gathering all of the href tags</li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">idea: make a series of <b>Tiny Core of Discovery</b> youtube videos:
      <ul>
        <li>install using VirtualBox for Windows</li>
        <li>install using QEMU for Windows</li>
        <li>note: <em>VirtualBox/QEMU are not necessary for Mac OS X and Linux, but will work if desired</em>.</li>
        <li>lead up to: how to remaster and create a disk image with a Python development environment pre-installed</li>
        <li>is this worth the effort? as everyone's goal should be to install/use a real linux distro, like Ubuntu/Debian</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  <h3>April 11, 2015</h3>
  cellipede can run on
  <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/tinycore_with_python_plus" target="_blank">Tiny Core with Python plus</a>,
  which is a great way to explore linux, python, git, and vim from within a Windows environment,
  and not wait around for time consuming installs (aka pipulate)
  <hr />

  <h3>April 3, 2015</h3>
  cellipede offers a <b>SERPs</b> function ... "What's your position in a google search ?"
  <br />
  note that the serps function does not use the deprecated API at https://developers.google.com/web-search/docs/,
  <br />
  rather it crawls/scrapes the exact same page as seen when a person performs a google search, but limited to about the first 100 results/positions

  <h3>March 31, 2015</h3>
  <p>
    cellipede can be used as a <b>service for all functions</b>:
    <br /><br />
    use it in a google spreadsheet like:
    <pre>
      =IMPORTHTML("http://cellipede.herokuapp.com/sheet_function?afunction=tweets&url=http://www.amazon.com/","table",1)
    </pre>
    or use it in another program, like curl:
    <pre>
      curl "http://cellipede.herokuapp.com/sheet_function?afunction=tweets&url=http://www.amazon.com/"
    </pre>
    or use it directly in a web browser:
    <pre>
      http://cellipede.herokuapp.com/sheet_function?afunction=tweets&url=http://www.amazon.com/
      or:
      http://cellipede.herokuapp.com/sheet_as_table?id=1
    </pre>
    this feature really <b>opens up</b> cellipede giving you access to all of the functions
    from just about anywhere
