      Most of my projects are crafted using Ruby <small>(manna from heaven)</small>,
      Python <small>(lesser manna)</small>,
      C <small>(no manna)</small>,
      and Java <small>(the opposite of manna)</small>.
      <br>
      And mostly in C/C++, which is good to know, after all that's what ruby, python, java are written in.

      Other languages I've used in the past:<br>
      mainframe: Pascal (college), Fortran, RPG, COBOL, PL/I, Natural/AdaBas, Assembler, C, REXX, JCL<br>
      pc: Turbo Pascal, Forth (self-altering code was cool), Basic, ASM, PowerBuilder, .NET, Smalltalk,
      Go, Ada, Prolog, Clojure, Javascript, Coffeescript, Tcl, PHP

this is the new look blog, as I just didn't like the old dated journal look
now it's just blocks of words, paragraphs, maybe like a book, kind of, or not at all ... just thoughts
normally I use Simplenote for this sort of thing as it's free and easy to access and private ... I still use it
</pre>

ES releases Watcher which an alert/notification api: query + condition + schedule + actions (email) ... probably not free :(

today is total work day, no porch, no sun, no cats, just jumping between C, python, and ruby for 2 apps

installed air conditioner last night as 90 degrees was just too hot

<a href="http://0pointer.net/blog/revisiting-how-we-put-together-linux-systems.html" target="_blank">interesting ... <em>Operating-System-As-A-Virus</em></a>

the beauty of Ruby and what few people understand ... simplified:
- <b>1.class</b> means <b>1</b> is an <b>object</b> whose <b>class</b> is Fixnum
- <b>Fixnum.instance_methods(false)</b> reveals this object to have these methods [:to_s, :+, :-, :==, etc], so
- <b>1.to_s</b> is really 1.send(:to_s) and <b>1 + 1</b> is really 1.send(:+, 1)
- yes, <b>send</b> is just passing a <b>message</b> to an <b>object</b>
- of course, I don't need to know about <em>sending messages to objects</em> just to do <b>1 + 1</b>
absolute beauty and why I say it's <b>manna from heaven</b>, ok, actually Japan
but it may be more beautiful to have a language like Smalltalk with only 6 keywords and no conditionals ... true OO

can't remember where I got these but every developer should be more:
<b>Smalltalk infected</b>
<b>Condition averse</b> (avoid if/else/case)
<b>Message centric</b>
  - don't own the behavoir of an object
  - null object pattern
  - composition ... beware of always using inheritance, it's not for sharing behavoir
  - independency injection for behavior
<b>Abstraction seeking</b>

another hot day, but it's the weekend and that's <em>my time</em> ... what to do today ?
turn on wifi, sit out on my new porch, and do some reading/research or watch conference videos ?
watch the grass grow, do nothing ? ... nothing is really something
</pre>

<pre>
at last the screening of the porch is done, both cats/skeeters hate it, I love it

the usual home chores plus 8 hours of programming every day, need a vacation

I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's, all sorts of projects but mostly camera oriented, and they're interesting and fun.
The Pi brings back memories of my first computer the Super ELF with one of the first RISC microprocessors (RCA 1802).
But it's so annoying to see/hear everyone repeat the <b>hype</b> that a Pi only costs $35, it's NOT true:
- shipping and handling
- it arrives and you unbox something that doesn't do anything
- no power supply
- no monitor
- no keyboard
- no mouse
all of the above cost extra money, so you're far closer to $100+ than $35
why does everyone continue to repeat <em>it only costs $35</em> ?

the Avengers movie was <em>ok</em>, who doesn't like watching the black widow jump around

a bit more work left on the porch today

drove 30 miles yesterday to get a burger and banana shake at a <em>drive in</em>, you know,
one of those places where you sit in your car and eat ... they still have those around here
the doctor would probably not like the idea of eating <em>drive in</em> food, but life's short so you've got to enjoy it sometimes
oh yeah, the banana shake actually had a real ripened banana in it ... it was oh so good

<a href="https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby" target="_blank">google-drive-ruby</a> looks interesting ... wonder how it compares to python's <a href="https://github.com/burnash/gspread" target="_blank">gspread</a> in terms of reliability
</pre>

<pre>
research what's involved with <b>updating</b> documents in elasticsearch and how such an action may affect a large amount of data

bought some expensive plexiglass for the entrance to the porch to keep out the rain

the neighbor's cat, aka my pets, as I feed/play with them, do not like the screened in porch ... there was much meowing and pacing

saw the doctor this morning about starting a more aggressive treatment of diabetes

maybe see the Avengers movie this evening as movies here are $5 ... to think I read comics growing up and now almost all of them are movies
</pre>

<pre>
yesterday was hot/humid, so I only finished one side of the porch ... two to go

probably should only work in the morning, which is possible now as I figured out a way to not use the noisy saw as much,
don't want to disturb the neighborhood

very little time spent on the computers yesterday, sweet

my very old neighbor, well, older than me, keeps visiting and retelling the same stories
</pre>

<pre>
discoverd <a href="http://riemann.io/" target="_blank">Riemann</a> over the weekend ... looks interesting so far, as does <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jcnc/2012/192913/" target="_blank">Holt-Winters anomaly detection</a>
anomaly detection, even with machine learning, is a <em>tough nut</em> in ids/ips

tired of <em>making fire</em> so must buy a gas bbq grill for chicken thighs, hamburgers, hot dogs, and veggies from the garden
sure, things won't taste as good as cooked over a fire, but <em>turning a knob and pressing a button</em> is so instantly gratifying

must finish screening in the porch, to sit outside without the skeeters eating me alive

maybe sleep out there at night, but I don't think <em>screen</em> is <b>bear</b> proof

hopefully I don't staple/hammer one of the neighbor's cats as they like to participate any time I'm outside doing stuff
... they're totally useless coz all they do is rub up against your legs or lay down on the hammer
... cats around here aren't afraid of cars, they stand in front of mine or get underneath,
they cross the street without looking both ways ... I've warned them

once the porch is done I can enjoy a view of the surrounding mountains ... a joy after many years of living in SF/NY/DC
or just stare at the neighbors as they back stare at me, lots of staring and waving around here
</pre>

<pre>
as the weather is supposed to be nice, I'm keeping computer time to a minimum and spending the day outside doing boring yard work.

maybe even finish screening the porch before those skeeters arrive ... I think next week is the start of a heat wave.

well, I'm off to move heavy stuff around and buy some screws ... it seems I purchase more than I construct.

with retirement just around the corner, less than 2 years now, I'm thinking of reversing how life is lived.
try to spend more time each day physically moving around, walking/jogging/playing, and less time sitting in front of a computer.
sure, I enjoy computers/programming but too much time with them is not healthy.
growing up I was fidgety and always on the move, but once I discovered programming that changed.
I stopped running long distances and playing tennis which I was once good enough at to play in college.
just thinking ... but I guess everyone thinks about returning to their youth sometimes.

The month of May is here and we're springing into summer, so it's spring cleaning time.

therefore, it's time to deprecate and stop all development on the <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/cellipede" target="_blank">Cellipede project</a>
originally the idea was to provide an alternative to gropey/pipulate, but the developer has become a stalker
and uses me as a sort of personal motivation ... so it's best to just ignore all of that and move on
as there are lots of way more interesting projects that are welcoming of others, not slow/unreliable, and
hasn't taken almost a year to code a weekend or two project

prepare the hummingbird feeders ... they're fun to watch and cool with the whole torpor thing they do

the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY" target="_blank">NLTK series</a> by sentdex has caught my eye ... his Scikit-learn series was great
it's refreshing to see good design/coding/testing even if he's not a professional programming,
but he has invested the time to learn enough to do a great job with great videos

an idea for a new project came to me this morning, but I won't reveal it here
it's always best to begin in a private github repo or local repo to avoid premature judgements,
then, maybe, go public/open-source once things are fleshed out

just RESTful api, no UI, see: <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask" target="_blank">restful</a> or <a href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.2/index.html" target="_blank">flask-restful</a>

the Amazon Fire TV arrived today, and I could do a useless <em>unboxing video</em> but I'll leave that to the advertising/marketing types
- it works great, almost as small as a Raspberry Pi
- maybe, at last, I can cut the cable company cord, well, for TV at least
- <em>knock on wood</em>, but this area has the fastest internet service I've ever experienced,
and that includes D.C. and New York city and other places that I have lived before ... it's amazing and I wonder why,
maybe, being in the mountains we have the <em>high ground</em>

spent some time learning about Action Cable and websockets coming in Rails 5 ... interesting

in the evening's twilight, I sat on the porch and shot my pistol and rifle at some rain drops, not sure I hit any,
but it's fun to aim at stuff ... I'm not a hunter unless going to Food Lion counts, I just like aiming at stuff (not animals)

create a python/scapy daemon to watch/count recurring hosts/ips within a given timeframe
this will see all hosts/ips on the nic and not just the ones that match a signature in snort/suricata
</pre>

<pre>
revive <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/uni2espy" target="_blank">Uni2Espy</a>, which processes unified2 files from snort/suricata/whatever and indexes them into Elasticsearch
