<h2 class="section-heading">falling&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 14, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Someone, maybe Einstein, once said that gravity is nothing more than a manifestation 
  due to everthing falling towards something bigger.&nbsp; The whole space-time 
  curvature idea.&nbsp; It's a bit like this: put a bowling ball on a mattress, then roll another 
  ball towards it, that ball will <b>fall</b> into the bowling ball.&nbsp; It's not being 
  <b>pulled</b> by some force emanating from the bowling ball, rather it falls into it 
  due to a curvature in the mattress.&nbsp; But most of us see gravity as something that 
  <b>pulls</b> things in and not as falling towards something.&nbsp; Perception.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">giving&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 13, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Often people say that we are all selfish most of the time.&nbsp; That's probably true.&nbsp; 
  How can we not be?&nbsp; We are human.&nbsp; However, for me, <b>giving to others</b> started back 
  in the early 2000's after working a lucrative programming gig.&nbsp; It was just plain luck that 
  I got the gig instead of someone else.&nbsp; So that unexpected wealth plus a promise to a 
  friend got me started giving to others.&nbsp; By <b>others</b> I mean random <b>others</b>.&nbsp; 
  I was also influenced by the books and movies: <i>Pay It Forward</i> and <i>Nobody's Fool</i>, 
  even though each book and movie are very different.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  So for a while it was a selfish act.&nbsp; It did make me feel good to give.&nbsp; 
  But after doing this for many years now, I don't really feel that way any more.&nbsp; I don't 
  feel anything.&nbsp; It's nice when the person says <i>thank you</i>, but I still don't 
  feel much of anything.&nbsp; Just to have something to say in email replies, I often spout 
  some new age bullshit about <b>abundance</b> or <b>attraction</b>.&nbsp;  That's total bullshit!&nbsp; 
  It seems the only thing humans can manifest is actual shit, you know poop.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  At this point, the act of giving and the recepients have all become some vague distant 
  random nothingness.&nbsp; Sometimes they don't even say <i>thank you</i>.&nbsp; 
  I just feel an empty, detached feeling of nothing.&nbsp; 
  So why continue?&nbsp; I suppose it's just something to do during retirement.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">journals&nbsp;<small>Wednesday, April 12, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  The following instagram photo shows some of the journals I've filled since becoming a hillbilly.&nbsp; The cardboard box 
  contains 12 older journals of 600+ pages each from about 1972 until 1985.&nbsp; I recently retrieved them from storage.&nbsp; 
  I could not fit the older more elaborate journals, aka scrapbook-like book of shadows, into the photo.&nbsp; 
  Several times I tried to capture this in a video for youtube, but I'm never satisfied with the end result.&nbsp; 
  Also, writing or reading or thinking a lot does not make one smart nor profound.&nbsp; That's obvious given 
  all of the blogs, opinions, e-books, and videos on the internet.&nbsp; I guess in a nutshell I've always been 
  given to searching and seeking.&nbsp; For what, I'm not sure.&nbsp; Just being human.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">milestone&nbsp;<small>Wednesday, April 12, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today marks yet another of life's milestones.&nbsp; My official retirement.&nbsp; Well, at least 
  from the government's point of view, as shown by receiving my first social security check.&nbsp; 
  Can one really celebrate this moment?&nbsp; On the one hand, yes, I get back the money I paid 
  into it, but on the other hand I am now <b>officially old</b>.&nbsp; I guess a better question 
  is do I feel old?&nbsp; Somedays, yes, and somedays, no.&nbsp; Again, <b>change</b> is about 
  the only thing you can depend on.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">walking&nbsp;<small>Tuesday, April 11, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  In the year 2015 I walked over 3,500 miles.&nbsp; 
  Last year in 2016 I walked over 2,900 miles.&nbsp; That's more than the Appalachian Trail.&nbsp; 
  About 8 miles every day.&nbsp; At my age of 62, that's too much.&nbsp; So in 2017 I'm 
  going to decrease that to about 4 miles per day.&nbsp; About 10,000 steps, an hour 
  and a half or so of continuous walking.&nbsp; Yes, I walk slow.&nbsp;  Yes, I will have to eat less.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  This will free up some time so I can read, write, and do little chores around the house.&nbsp; 
  Or just sit on the porch, do nothing, and watch life go by.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">mow, salsa, mushrooms&nbsp;<small>Monday, April 10, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today I caved in and mowed the yard like all of my neighbors.&nbsp; It is April, 
  and I hate mowing as it's just a useless chore.&nbsp; For everyone in these parts, 
  mowing seems to be a hobby they love, so much so, that some of them do it as a side 
  job.&nbsp; It was in the 80's, so it was hot, and a good day to have some salsa 
  and mushrooms.&nbsp; Since I avoid sugar, flour, starch, which are all really 
  sugar, I replace the tortilla chips with mushrooms.&nbsp; Mushrooms are sometimes 
  referred to as <i>the eaters of the dead</i>.&nbsp; So it's a kind of life and 
  death combo in food form.&nbsp; But it really just tastes good and is refreshing 
  and hydrating on a hot day after mowing the yard.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">lazy day&nbsp;<small>Sunday, April 9, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Growing up christian means doing absolutely nothing on Sunday's.&nbsp; Maybe some family time.&nbsp; 
  For me it is no longer a religious thing.&nbsp; It's just socially acceptable, in america 
  anyways, to be lazy on this day.&nbsp; It's silly but nice.&nbsp; In the past few years, I 
  spend most Sunday's walking and reading which are two of my favorite things.&nbsp; 
  Unfortunately, I can remember a time when I worked every day of every week.&nbsp; Very exhausting.&nbsp; 
  However, I can remember a few times when I was unemployed and homeless--no food, no money.&nbsp; 
  So I've learned to go with the flow, and to live life a bit like air or water.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">a rant filled with info&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  It's not often that when someone goes on a <b>rant</b> that it contains any useful information.&nbsp; 
  Me included.&nbsp; Most often it's just someone speaking so passionately that 
  they are almost in tears, and, well, it's unpleasant to see someone weep while gnashing their teeth.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  But in this rant (in 2015?) by Michelle Belanger she offers a bit of history and background information:
  <br /><br />
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CucbeFZ3FlQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br />
  Like a lot of us, over time, she's a bit conflicted.&nbsp; She's been a goth, wiccan, witch, vampire, psychic, 
  TV personality, non-fiction writer, and fiction writer.&nbsp; Again, like a lot of us, we tend to be all over the 
  place as we learn and grow older.&nbsp; Not to mention the obvious that sometimes one has to do whatever 
  to earn some money and survive.&nbsp; Oh well, variety is the spice of life, right?

<h2 class="section-heading">strange blog indeed&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  As blogs go, this one is different.&nbsp; Most blogs are organized by year and month and in chronological 
  order.&nbsp; They have fancy graphics and colors to sparkle and grab your attention.&nbsp; 
  Not mine.&nbsp; I chose to divide the writing into different aspects of existence as I see it, and to focus 
  on the words alone.&nbsp; 
  This matches with how I write in my journals, which I've done everyday for many years now.&nbsp; It is an 
  obsession.&nbsp; I don't fool myself into believing that there's anything profound in my writing or even 
  interesting to someone else.&nbsp; Yet, I continue to do it.&nbsp; If anyone is actually reading this 
  blog they probably find it annoying to have to click on the nav bar links just to read the latest posts.&nbsp; 
  That's not a smart way to build and audience.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp; <br />
  Someday I will make a youtube that shows the pile of journals I recently retrieved from storage.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Also, I am considering adding a new link to the nav bar called <b>memoirs</b>.&nbsp; There I would just 
  <i>dump</i> stuff about me.&nbsp; I already have a lot of it handwritten in notebooks, and some of that 
  typed into text files that are in a private repo on github.&nbsp; But it might be interesting to try to 
  make them public, with more of a focus on turning the writings into a book.&nbsp; 
  Just a thought of an old person nearing the end of life, and memoirs are probably a common thought.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">feeling vs appearance&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  How do you feel right now, this very moment?&nbsp; For me, if I ignore the constant pain in my knee, middle 
  back(spine), and stomach I feel perfect.&nbsp; What if you look in a full length mirror?&nbsp; Now, how 
  do you feel?&nbsp; Yep, you're not as perfect as maybe you once were.&nbsp; The same goes for hopping on a 
  scale to check your weight, or feeling those bulges of fat you have here and there.&nbsp; But is appearance 
  anywhere near as important as how you actually feel?&nbsp; I guess it really boils down to desire.&nbsp; So 
  can you let go of your desires long enough to really feel?&nbsp; Try thinking and doing nothing for 
  some part of everyday.&nbsp; That can be difficult to do if you have family responsibilities, I know.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">hide contact form email to avoid spam&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="_blank">Formspree</a> is free for 1000 submissions per email each month.&nbsp; 
  Their service has been around for a while, so I'm giving it a try, so far so good.&nbsp; I doubt I will ever get anywhere 
  near 1000 emails per month, thankfully.&nbsp; However, if one just follows the instructions on their website you 
  will be exposing your email to spammers and bots that harvest emails.&nbsp; So a better approach is to hide 
  your email by encoding it as base64 and then using javascript to decode it for the contact's form action.&nbsp; 
  Sure, any human could just use some javascript to decode, but spammers rely on automation--otherwise that's not
  spamming.&nbsp; Also, I do get some spam anyways as my email is listed on several social media sites.&nbsp; 
  What's next?&nbsp; Maybe give <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a> a try for comments, 
  as most people don't really like sending emails even through a contact form.&nbsp; Then again, as I am not selling me 
  or anything, building an audience is not really important to me.&nbsp; Maybe not, as using Disqus probably means 
  that ad's appear, which is something I find annoying.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">mandela effect&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 7, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Just watched the video 
  <a href="https://youtu.be/QgwQezM3MxI" target="_blank">Explaining the Mandela Effect (Prepare to have your brain scrambled!)</a> 
  by The Paranormal Scholar.&nbsp; As always her presentation is cool and interesting, but it did not scramble my brain.&nbsp; 
  Often it seems the obvious gets overlooked in things like this, which is the fact that people are involved.&nbsp; 
  In other words, the common bit is the human condition.&nbsp; So is it really all that surprising that similar 
  things happen to different people, afterall we are not that different from each other.&nbsp; My <b>I</b> and your 
  <b>I</b> are almost exactly the same.&nbsp; The skeptic flag is also raised by the appearance of any 
  reference to psychology--Carl Jung.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; The answer lies in quantum theory, multiverses, an 
  astronaut's theory, and psychology all mashed up together, really?&nbsp; Instead of the obvious facts that human 
  memories are imperfect and humans are almost exact clones of each other.&nbsp; 
  Brain scrambling, no, thought provoking, yes.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Also, their website really sucks because WordPress sucks, pop ups that force me to click suck!&nbsp; 
  The description for this video contains a much better motto for their channel:
  <i>Discussion is the lifeblood of understanding</i>, which is much better than: 
  <i>The more you know, the more there is to fear</i>.&nbsp; 
  I know, way too much complaining.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">following&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 7, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  There's something about the word <b>following</b> that doesn't sit well with me.&nbsp; 
  Yet, I started following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheParanormalScholar" target="_blank">The Paranormal Scholar</a> 
  on YouTube.&nbsp; Mostly I watch their history documentaries and not the paranormal garbage.&nbsp; 
  I don't like their motto: <i>The more you know, the more there is to fear</i>.&nbsp; I get they are 
  just trying to increase subscribers/views by being dramatic.&nbsp; But that doesn't make any sense, as 
  who in their right mind would want more fear.&nbsp; Perhaps, they're targeting those into horror movies.&nbsp; 
  However, their history videos are well researched and lack the overly dramatic stuff.&nbsp; Of course, 
  this dichotomy between history and paranormal makes me doubt their content on the whole, but it's 
  just entertainment afterall.&nbsp; Their own conflict is apparent in the channel title: paranormal and scholar.&nbsp; 
  For learning about history I tend to view things like 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK_NHLbnG-k9a3-TQCeW1G3aTZLhxgvI8" target="_blank">The Other Side of History</a>, 
  of course this is just as limited by the known as anything else--i.e. just because it has a college professor that 
  is lecturing does not make it's content totally accurate.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  The reason I don't like the word <i>paranormal</i> is that I feel that anything we can experience 
  is actually <b>normal</b>.&nbsp; Isn't seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and feeling all normal things for
  people to do?&nbsp; Assuming one can do those things.&nbsp; The word <i>paranormal</i> just has too 
  many negative connotations, whether it deserves them or not.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">trying to not think&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today is one of those days where I <b>do not want to think about anything</b>.&nbsp; 
  Have you ever tried to do that?&nbsp; 
  It is not easy to do.&nbsp; Many years ago when I ran six or miles everyday, it was much easier to 
  reach a point where my mind would just get quiet.&nbsp; I don't know if that was because of all of 
  those chemicals released when a body is under stress.&nbsp; Meditation just never worked for me.&nbsp; 
  So now I'm stuck with just going for long walks, which only kind of quiets my mind but mostly I seem to 
  think about everything: past, present, and future.&nbsp; Mind chatter is just a natural thing, like digesting food.&nbsp; 
  Sometimes it works to completely exhaust myself by not sleeping enough, and eventually it seems to catch 
  up with me and I completely pass out.&nbsp; It is a healthy thing if you can stop thinking even for brief moments.&nbsp; 
  A friend had the idea that there should exist places, like beautiful parks or gardens, where one 
  can just go and <i>somehow</i> while you are in there you can't think about anything.&nbsp; It's a great 
  idea, but how to achieve that <i>somehow</i> is the mystery.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">do it again&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  <i>Do it again</i> is something often said by children and implied by animals/pets.&nbsp; 
  And if you think about it, in a way, that simple phrase holds the meaning to why everything exists.&nbsp; 
  Could it be that what we call life and death is little more than the desire to <b>do it again</b>?&nbsp; 
  As in all over again, through fresh new eyes, so to speak.&nbsp; 
  To marvel at and play amongst everything that exists around us.&nbsp; To experience everything.&nbsp; 
  Yes, even pain and suffering, although I doubt anything that has feelings would ever say <i>do it again</i>.&nbsp; 
  But pain, suffering, and other unpleasant stuff are a part of existence and just another experience.&nbsp; 
  Don't get me wrong, as I am in no way belittling pain and suffering because I have struggled with both 
  of these for many years now.&nbsp; Daily I struggle to cope with physical chronic knee, back, and stomach pain.&nbsp; 
  Given my past, I also struggle with mental pain.&nbsp; Both together equal quite a bit of suffering.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">over population&nbsp;<small>Tuesday, April 4, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I have heard the <b>everyone fits in Texas myth</b> repeated a lot 
  in blogs, NPR, and videos.&nbsp; In case you don't know, the Texas myth is that Earth is not 
  really over populated because everyone could fit in an area the size of the state of Texas.&nbsp; 
  Assuming we could tolerate being that close to each other, personally, I think we are too close 
  to each other as it is now.&nbsp; Here's an old school internet style web page that goes into further 
  <a href="http://ingles.homeunix.net/rants/density.html" target="_blank">details</a>.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  For those of us who love nature, it is frustrating to watch as planet Earth 
  is raped, pillaged, and plundered.&nbsp; Then again, the Earth was here before humans and 
  will be here long after we are gone.&nbsp; It survived the dinosaurs consuming everything 
  in sight, and will survive whatever we do as well.&nbsp; Yet, it's still frustrating and 
  sad to just standby and only watch it all go down the crapper.&nbsp; <b>Change</b> is the only 
  reliable thing, whether or not we think it's for the better or worse.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">rant about blogs&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 1, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Why do people have text in their blogs that looks like it does in printed books?&nbsp;
  By that I mean why is the right hand margin all even and lined up ... it looks weird.&nbsp;
  Does anyone space out words to even up the right hand margin when they write by hand.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
  It just looks weird and unnatural.&nbsp; Yes, I get why they do it in books, to save on 
  the cost of paper.&nbsp; But it still looks weird and hyphenated words are annoying to read.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">reading and writing &nbsp;<small>Thursday, March 30, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I downloaded the PDF for this book:
  <br />
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thirty-Years-Among-Dead-Wickland-ebook/dp/B005HZK0D0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank">
    Thirty Years Among the Dead
  </a> 
  &nbsp;<small>by Dr. Carl A. Wickland, M.D.</small>&nbsp;
  <br />
  The PDF is free if you google the title, not sure how amazon can get away charging $2 for it.&nbsp; 
  Also, I have spent some time rearranging and writing for this blog, of which I'm probably the only reader.&nbsp; 
  I did link to here from my youtube about page as well as instagram.&nbsp; And I did submit the URL 
  to google's search engine.&nbsp; Maybe it's just me but I find that when I read a lot I don't often 
  have much to write, other than boring daily life stuff -- which I already hand write in a journal.&nbsp; 
  This should not surprise me, after all, when is the last time I read anything that was 
  <i>earth shattering</i> or even all that profound about the human condition.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Been thinking about my feelings after visiting the 
  <a href="https://cleesmith.github.io/spirit.html" target="_blank">hospital</a> last night.&nbsp; Not 
  because I was ill or injured but it's something I do often.&nbsp; Hospitals are like revolving 
  doors between the land of living and the land of the dead.&nbsp; Maybe <i>realm</i> is a 
  better word than <i>land</i>.

<h2 class="section-heading">retrieved from storage &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 29, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Since I completed working on a programming gig I started last month, I went and retrieved some 
  items from storage.&nbsp;   I like having empty rooms and closets in my house, so I pay to store things I 
  want to keep, you know, in those secure and climate controlled storage places.&nbsp;   I retrieved two boxes 
  of old journals (some are what I use to call "book of shadows"), a bunch of old books (to be reread and
  reviewed), some old t-shirts, candles, and art supplies I had forgot I bought.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Often when I am grieving over the loss of someone I become nostalgic and gather around me some old things.&nbsp; 
  Also, I tend to write and read even more than usual, which is normally a lot.&nbsp;   So I have started to focus on my 
  blog again and thinking about what direction my YouTube videos should take in the future.&nbsp;   I am considering 
  a new Google account to allow for a <i>pen name</i> and be more anonymous.&nbsp;   As we all know, the world is 
  filled with <i>whacko's</i> and <i>wing nut's</i> which are best kept as far away as possible.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">blogging, yet again &nbsp;<small>Monday, February 20, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
It has been a long time since I've updated this blog so here goes.&nbsp; 
Using github.&nbsp; io makes this blog cost nothing ($0) for anyone with a github account (also free).&nbsp; 
If you don't mind a domain name like <a href="https://cleesmith.github.io/" target="_blank">cleesmith.github.io</a> 
then it's totally free.&nbsp; 
One could also use a custom domain, as explained

<h2 class="section-heading">rant about websites</h2>
<blockquote><b>It is so damn annoying!</b></blockquote>
<p>
  Why are there so many websites where the <b>meat</b> of the page is totally surrounded by ad's,
  tiny videos, <i>follow us</i>, and other annoying garbage?  I guess the "word" is
  not as powerful as we've been told.&nbsp; 
  We actually came to their page to read the article, and not to be bombarded by ad's, pop-up's, or whatever.&nbsp; 
  It gets worse as you scroll down while reading -- <b>pop up's</b> occur or videos start playing or
  the page refreshes parts of itself and becomes unresponsive.&nbsp; 
  My usual reaction is to immediately close the page.&nbsp;  Yes, I will not follow, nor like, nor participate 
  in such annoying nonsense -- usually the content on such websites is totally useless.&nbsp; 
  There should be a web browser setting that can only load the <b>readable text</b> on a page and nothing else.&nbsp; 
  You know, like the old days of the internet.&nbsp; 
  Ok, I found <a href="http://www.textise.net/" target="_blank">Textise</a> which is slow but makes annoying 
  websites more readable.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">health &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 30, 2016</small></h2>
<p>
<span>
  The two biggest health problems are <b>chance</b> and <b>time</b>.&nbsp; 
  By <b>chance</b> I mean one may be predisposed to certain illnesses, it's just the
  luck (bad luck) of the draw.&nbsp; 
  By <b>time</b> I mean everything happens so slowly as to be almost imperceptable.&nbsp; 
  We suck at observing the small and slow changes that occur to our bodies.&nbsp; 
  We seem to only notice things just after they have happened -- like noticing you are 
  over 40 years old and suddenly you need reading glasses.&nbsp;  As a voracious reader 
  that was a bad day.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  It always seems to be a <b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
<span>Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.&nbsp; </span>
<span>After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.&nbsp; </span>
<span>You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>When it comes to calories, life is not fair.&nbsp; </span>
<span>
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting so much and focus on the quality of what you eat and eat less of it.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<p>
<span>Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.&nbsp; </span>
<br />
<span>There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.&nbsp; </span>
<span>For example <b>-- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts --</b> these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have a beer belly too.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<p>
<span>Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.&nbsp; </span>
<span>In fact, we do not need to eat any carbohydrates, but fruit is nice sometimes.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>
  Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.<br />
  <small>Hippocrates</small><br />
  <small>
    That's a nice quote, but don't forget that Hippocrates was a male in ancient Greece.<br />
    Which means he thought women were lesser humans, as in suffering from <b>hysteria</b> and 
    a <b>wandering uterus</b>.<br />
    And so, take his advice with a lot of salt.
