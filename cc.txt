#TarotTag8
1. How old were you when you first began using the Tarot?
  An infant, there's a photo of me in a crib slobbering on the death card, which
  I'm sure my Granny intended to signify "change".  Granny always talked to me 
  about folklore, Cherokee, and tarot reading. Seriously, when I left home for college, so 18.

2. What kind of themes/color schemes do you most love and prefer in Tarot Decks?
  Until recently, like the past 2 years, only RWS decks.
  The first deck I bought was the Albano-Waite when I lived in California.
  At this point, I've really enjoyed decks like the Mary-el, so dark and bright colors?

3. How many Tarot Decks do you have (either exact number or approximate number, including Tarot kits)?
  From 1976 until 2015 only the commonly available RWS and my favorite Albano (just coz of the colors), so 
  1 or 2 for many years.  But I inherited/gifted 3 large cedar chests that are filled with 
  tarot cards, magic cards, etc. One is from Granny and 2 from my friend ... both were tarot readers.
  
4. Do you do Daily Draws?  Yes, as well as different oracle cards.

5. What about other Divination Systems? 
    - any type of casting: stones, sticks, bones, dried beans, and cards
    - bird flights and dowsing sticks, if they counts ? ... from granny to predict weather/other

   Do you use them with the Tarot, or by themselves?  
    I have never them with tarot.

6. Memory (as in memorized meanings) or Intuition (as in Intuitive Insights) ?
  I was coached by both mentors, but they stressed "going with my gut" ... intuition ?

7. Where are you with the Tarot right now? 
  In other words, do you feel you are a novice, beginner, intermediate, advanced, or mastery level?
  - not sure what each means, but I did "in-person" readings for 13 years, just about every Thu/Fri/Sat/Sun evening
    with a friend (she was my 2nd mentor)
  - I always shook their hand (M/F), plus they were on the other side of a small table (3 feet away).
    Maybe I'm wrong but I really believe it matters to be within the querent's aura (so to speak) ... no 
    offense to online/internet readers.

8. What is your next step with the Tarot? - mostly focused on myself, so inward stuff
  Are you thinking about creating a Tarot Deck?  - I've created a deck a year since 1976, and one before that as a child
  Or working with a new Tarot Deck? - nothing specific, as new decks are a recent thing for me
  Or a new Tarot practice? - again, nothing specific, but reading books and the online community are inspiring me to expand
  Or something else? - nothing else, for now

can see that it has been said of this
book that you should not read from it
aloud even reading from it or owning it
having it in your possession can be
dangerous so you guys think energy can
