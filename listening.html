<h2>Maximus and Lucky</h2>

<p>
Early one morning I went for a jog on a trail, previously train tracks, that ran alongside a mountain river. Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, a larger than usual German Shepard dog rockets pass me then stops and looks back in that playful way dogs do.  I was startled and looked around for his owner but there was no one in sight.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
I went for a jog on the scenic river trail instead of the usual loop around town.
</p>
<p>
A big dog Maximus, thought it was a good name for him, suddenly appears and seems in a playful mood.  I called him Maximus as he reminded me of that dog in the opening scene of the movie Gladiator.
</p>
<p>
His owner was nowhere to be seen, so I waited for a bit then continued jogging and he followed.
</p>
<p>
He was one of those dogs who had to lead, so he ran ahead while smelling and peeing on everything … it was fun to have a big dog again, albeit temporary, I hoped.
</p>
<p>
We jogged, Maximus loped as dogs do, often running down the hill and splashing around in the ice cold river or dashing after a squirrel. This continued for about 3 miles then I turned around to head back to the car, again he follows.
</p>
<p>
Then we encountered a young lady and her dog named Lucky, I said Maximus is not my dog, and she was able to read his dog tags … actually his name was Lugar and he had a phone number.
</p>
<p>
The dogs start playing which usually involves rough and tumble action with a hint of dominance, so it seems to occur to Maximus that he could dominate Lucky, so he does.  And things get a bit out of hand and the young lady actually says “I don’t know what to do” and kind of starts to cry … scared for Lucky, I suppose.  Until the past few years there has always been a big dog in my life, so I just automatically ordered Maximus(preferred over Lugar as dogs like words with an “s” sound in them) to “stop” then “come” then “sit” which he does so I grab his collar, then I ordered Lucky to “sit” and he does … this surprises me a little.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the young lady grabs my arm, wipes her eyes, and says “thank you”.  She then proceeds to open up, for some reason, and talk about all sorts of things going on in her life.  I listen and repeat some of what she says:
<ol>
<li>to show I am really listening 
<li>to allow her to correct anything I am not understanding clearly
</ol>
 </p>
<hr>
<p>
To look at this event from a different perspective … what does it say that we were 2 miles from the nearest road, home, or any people and yet she was trusting a much larger male stranger in the company of a big dog?
</p>

<p>
So, what is the point of this seemingly meaningless encounter?  Some sign or omen, a message, an oracle, something profound, probably not, but what is, really?

<p>
However, what came to mind was the card labeled “LISTEN” I had drawn from the Peace Oracle a few days ago for the candle light setting videos I have been doing.

<p>
This reminded me of something I became aware of when doing in-person tarot readings for 13 years, and that is, that most often what people are really looking for is someone to truly listen to them.  It really does matter that someone is interested in their thoughts.  And not always trying to provide a solution for their problems, as most of us realize(if not consciously) that “only we can prevent forest fires”(in the immortal words of Smokey the bear).  I believe that listening to yourself or someone else is a giving act … a gift of your time, your NOW, your presence in those moments.  And it is not an easy thing to do given that our own inner voice(ego) is relentlessly chattering away at us.  In a way, any encounter can be seen as a creative act.  We may become entwined with each other to form, if we are lucky, something that did not exist before.  Even if that only means learning a tiny bit about someone else, or just a few moments of shared peace.
</p>
<p>
Also, and this is not meant to sound judgmental, but it concerns me a little bit that this sort of interaction between people is not truly possible with remote readings (e.g. video or snail mail).  In that a key component of helping someone is missing, as in listening and being there with them.  Yes, I am aware of the web or the collective conscious/unconscious/whatever and if that helps someone then that is cool with me, but I have tried many online readings over the past year and the listening aspect seems missing to me.  Again, this is just a thought that occurred and not meant as a “put down” or a passing of judgment.
</p>
<p>
So if you are able and up to the challenge of doing so, perhaps try to really listen to someone occasionally.
