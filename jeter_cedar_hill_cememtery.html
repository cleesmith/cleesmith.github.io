    HAUNTED&#8200;STATUE? &mdash; 
    <br /><br />
    This statue, marking the James <b>Jeter
    family&rsquo;s plot in Cedar Hill Cemetery</b>, is reported to be haunted.
    James Jeter came to Covington around 1892 to serve as a teacher and
    principal of the Covington School. <br /> He later served as
    superintendent of Alleghany County and Clifton Forge schools. Jeter-
    Watson Intermediate School is named in his memory. <br /> The ghost of
    his wife, Annie, who died in 1912, is said to still haunt the Jeter-
    Watson Center building on Pine Street (D.S. Crosier Photo) <br />

<p> 
  I can&rsquo;t say that I
  don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, because, frankly, I&rsquo;m not sure if
  I do or not. <br />I&rsquo;ve never seen one; but just because
  I&rsquo;ve never seen a ghost doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t
  exist, right?<br /><br />But there are some folks that really take
  this ghost-hunting stuff seriously. <br />They go to supposedly-
  haunted places, use high-tech gadgetry and doo-dads to try and pick up
  energy waves given off by those of the spirit variety and utilize the
  &ldquo;powers&rdquo; of those that claim to be one with the spirit
  world to talk with the long-since dead. <br />There&rsquo;s a whole
  slew of paranormal-related sites on the internet.<br /><br />Look them
  up sometime; they&rsquo;re kind of interesting.<br />That&rsquo;s all
  well and good, I guess, but I&rsquo;m just not into that stuff. <br
  />I can't see me strapping on one of those corny Ghostbusters
  backpacks and traipsing around at all hours of the night looking for
  evidence of paranormal activity; and, to be honest, most of those
  ghost-hunting adventures take place in the wee hours of a morning, and
  I&rsquo;m getting to the age that, unless my excitement is going to
  happen sometime before 9 o&rsquo;clock at night, I&rsquo;d just as
  soon be in bed reading.<br />That brings me to today&rsquo;s case. <br
  />I&rsquo;ll take one long-standing local urban legend and try to find
  out just where that legend comes from.<br />Did Annie Jeter die
  falling down the stairs on her wedding day, as the tale goes? <br
  />Does her statue in Cedar Hill Cemetery drip blood every
  Halloween?<br />Today, we&rsquo;ll look at the myths, we&rsquo;ll look
  at the facts and we&rsquo;ll see what exactly makes up this local
  legend.<br />So, sit back and relax, for today I&rsquo;ll try to
  expose the truth behind &ldquo;The Ghost of Mrs. Jeter.&rdquo; <br />
  I did something earlier this year that I&rsquo;ve never done before
  &mdash; I helped coach a Covington youth-league volleyball team. <br
  />I&rsquo;ve never coached anything of any kind before, unless you
  count a couple of church softball games years ago and we weren&rsquo;t
  very good, so I don&rsquo;t count that.<br />I&rsquo;m proud to report
  that my mouth only got me in trouble once, which resulted in Allen
  Dressler benching me for one night.<br />Those that know me know
  that&rsquo;s a victory in and of itself.<br />Anyway, one Saturday
  afternoon, as we were practicing in the Jeter-Watson Center gym
  (which, when I was in school, was called Jeter-Watson Middle School;
  it was used as a school until the new Jeter-Watson opened in 2009),
  one of my girls knocked the volleyball over my head and into the old
  girl&rsquo;s locker room.<br />I told her to go get it, as I was too
  lazy to go and do it myself. <br />&ldquo;Nuh uh,&rdquo; she
  proclaimed loudly while shaking her head. &ldquo;This place is
  haunted!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; I asked.<br />&ldquo;This
  place is haunted,&rdquo; she said again, louder this time.<br
  />&ldquo;By whom,&rdquo; I asked.<br />&ldquo;By Mrs. Jeter,&rdquo;
  she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gotta be true because I read about it in
  the Jeter-Watson newspaper.&rdquo;<br />Keep in mind, this is an 11
  -year-old girl telling me this.<br />As I continued my query, I
  wasn&rsquo;t able to get the girl, who never did go in and get thae
  ball out of the locker room, to tell me who Mrs. Jeter was or why she
  would haunt an old school building.<br />In the end, The Wife went and
  got the ball for me, if my memory serves me correctly.<br />I knew
  from the basic histories of the area that The Boss (Horton) wrote
  through the years, the Jeter-Watson name came from the old Jeter
  School, which was located on Locust Street where the Mid-City Mall
  parking lot is today, and Watson High School, which served as the
  African-American high school until desegregation in the 1960s.<br
  />The Jeter School was&nbsp; built around 1917 or 1918 and was named
  after James Garrett Jeter, who was a teacher, principal and
  superintendent in Covington schools in the early part of the 20th
  Century. <br />It was torn down in 1969.<br />What is now known as the
  Jeter-Watson Center was originally built as a Works Progress
  Administration project between 1939 and 1940, at the same time the
  current Covington High School building on Lexington Avenue was
  built.<br />So I knew from the dates of when the building was built
  and the fact that I was pretty sure Mr. Jeter had gone on to The Great
  Whatever before the Watson building was built, I thought it quite
  impossible that his, I assumed, wife&rsquo;s spirit would be haunting
  it &mdash; especially not in the locker room, of all places. <br
  />Those locker rooms were absolutely gross when I was in school there
  30 years ago and I doubt any self-respecting lady specter would be
  caught dead (no pun intended) in there now.<br />I first looked into
  who James Jeter was, and the information is really not that abundant.
  <br />He was born in Franklin County in 1860, came to Covington in
  about 1892 to become a teacher and principal at the Covington School,
  married a lady named Annie Maria in 1894 and became school
  superintendent for Alleghany County and Clifton Forge schools in 1910,
  retiring in July 1933.<br />For those of you who don&rsquo;t know,
  Covington did not become a city until the 1950s. <br />Up until that
  time, schools in the town of Covington were partnered with those in
  Alleghany County, comprising one school division.<br />A consolidated
  school system?<br />But I digress.<br />Sadly, his Annie died in 1912
  at the age of 48 and was buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery. <br />At some
  point along the way, a statue was placed in front of her grave and
  depicts a lady walking down a set of steps. <br />Here is where the
  facts begin turning into urban legend.<br />One of the folk tales
  behind the ghost of Mrs. Jeter is one where she falls down the steps
  on her wedding day, breaking her neck. <br />It is said the statue
  depicts poor Annie&rsquo;s last moments, just before she takes her
  final plunge.<br />That&rsquo;s a morbid sentiment to leave your loved
  one, if you ask me.<br />That&rsquo;s impossible, seeing as she had
  been married 18 years when she died and she and The Mister had three
  kids together &ndash; two sons and a daughter.<br />There&rsquo;s also
  an urban legend that the Jeter statue drips blood on Halloween night.
  <br />Just to see if that were true &ndash; and, yes I actually
  checked &ndash; I traveled to Cedar Hill last Halloween, about 8
  o&rsquo;clock that night (so I could be home in bed by 9, remember)
  and can report that no blood was dripping from any of the Jeter statue
  appendages. <br />In looking at the haunting of the former Jeter-
  Watson Center, I find it highly illogical that she would have haunted
  that particular building, as she was long gone before it was even
  built. <br />I say that because, from my research into the paranormal,
  spirits tend to haunt places and people that have some individual
  significance to them &ndash; a former house, a jilted lover, you get
  the idea. <br />She had no connection to that building in life, so
  it&rsquo;s a far stretch for me to believe she stumbled upon it in
  death.<br />Also, spirits, seeing as spirits are supposedly composed
  of energy left behind when a living person travels on, the energy is
  drawn to the energy of those of the living. <br />It stands to reason
  that if Mrs. Jeter was, in fact, haunting the former Watson/Jeter-
  Watson building on Pine Street, she would have most likely moved on to
  the new Jeter-Watson school when the old building was closed down in
  2009; and, to my knowledge, there&rsquo;s not been any strange goings-
  on over there during its short tenure, except for the way they teach
  math nowadays, which is another story for another day.<br />So how did
  the legend of Mrs. Jeter come about in the first place?<br />By their
  very nature, urban legends tend to take root in some kernel of&nbsp;
  truth. <br />In this case, Mrs. Jeter did die relatively young and
  there is a statue of a lady walking down the steps; but I think
  what&rsquo;s happened is, through the years, the legend of Mrs. Jeter
  has melded with the tragic tale of another of Cedar Hill&rsquo;s
  eternal residents, Martha Skeens Jordan.<br />&nbsp;Walk across the
  lane from the Jeter statue, head&nbsp; down toward Carpenter Drive and
  you&rsquo;ll find the Jordan family plot and one of the most unique
  tombstones I&rsquo;ve ever seen; and a bizarre story to go along with
  it.<br />It&rsquo;s shaped like a keyhole and is the stone for Martha
  and her infant daughter, Lucy Ira Jordan.<br />The story goes that
  Martha gave birth to Lucy on Nov. 9, 1847, but the baby died just two
  months later.<br />Gripped by grief, Martha died a month after Lucy,
  on Feb. 28, 1848. <br />Or so they thought.<br />About 40 years after
  her &ldquo;death,&rdquo; her body was exhumed, to be placed in a new
  coffin and interred in the Jordan family plot where she and Lucy now
  rest.<br />When the casket lid was opened, Martha was turned over on
  her face and her hand was up at her head.<br />For the mid-1800s, the
  notion of being buried alive was not out of the realm of possibility;
  heck, even today, most people will tell you that being buried alive is
  one of their biggest fears.<br />Mine&rsquo;s snakes, if you were
  wondering.<br />When Martha apparently died, her doctor naturally
  assumed she succumbed to apoplexy, which was kind of a catch-all
  diagnosis when a certain cause could not be found right away.<br
  />Knowing both Annie Jeter&rsquo;s story, and knowing Martha
  Jordan&rsquo;s tragic outcome, it&rsquo;s really not too far-fetched
  to think their stories might collide into one juicy urban legend.<br
  />My only foray into a study of the supernatural at Cedar Hill began
  almost two years ago, shortly after my daughter was buried there.<br
  />It never happened when I was there before her death, but now
  everytime I make my daily visit to Babygirl&rsquo;s grave, my fire
  department-issued pager goes nuts. <br />Usually, it only does that
  when I&rsquo;m around powerful electronics. <br />It goes buck-wild,
  for instance, when I go into Food Lion.<br />But there&rsquo;s no
  electronic devices anywhere close to her grave at Cedar Hill.<br
  />Hmm. <br />Think about that one.<br />
  <hr />
  Cedar Hill isn&rsquo;t the
  only final resting place in the Alleghany Highlands that is noted for
  things that go bump in the night.<br />Take the <b>Mallow Family cemetery</b>
  over in Jackson Heights.<br />There&rsquo;s an urban legend that I
  recently came across that says if you go to the old graveyard at 2:30
  in the morning (what an ungodly hour) and wait, a man will appear out
  of nowhere and start smoking a cigarette.<br />The tale goes that
  he&rsquo;ll walk up to you and stare menacingly at you with evil
  eyes.<br />Unlike most ghosts, this one even talks to you.<br />I
  can&rsquo;t tell the rest of it&nbsp; as poetically like the person I
  got it from, so I&rsquo;ll let her report what happened next
  &mdash;&nbsp; 
  <blockquote>
    &ldquo;If you want a real good scare, go to this old
    graveyard over here in Jackson Heights. But when I was looking into
    his eyes, I swear all you could feel is like full evil was around you,
    and it felt like you were trying to be pulled into the Earth. I was
    too scared to even say anything. He was even talking to me, too. 
    <b>I remember because he even asked me if I was scared of him and 
    when I replied back, that&rsquo;s when he said I should be</b>. 
    And I&rsquo;m not
    lying, neither. But we really don&rsquo;t like talking about it,
    though, or to be asked about it.&rdquo;
  </blockquote>
  Take that legend for what
  it&rsquo;s worth, but I don&rsquo;t ever recall my friends Bob and
  Janet Baker telling me they smoked a stogie with any spectral
  neighbors before.<br />I&rsquo;ll have to ask them sometime.<br />I
  guess I&rsquo;ll never get to experience that one, unless he wants to
  come by the house about 7 or 8 o&rsquo;clock. <br />I never turn down
  the chance to have a good smoke.
