  <ul>
    feel like ranting so here goes:
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      it's puzzling how some people can give programming advice when they are so obviously not a programmer,
      but only dabble at it, and yet regurgitate all of this stuff they have read and misunderstand
      <br>
      with no proof of experience as their github account only has a single slow and unreliable python project
      <br>
      if you have never coded anything in ruby then shut up ... you don't know wet if you're never touched water
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      things that are not new nor <em>next gen</em> or even interesting:
      <ul>
        <li>calling external api's ... this has been done in lots of apps for many years now</li>
        <li>
          locking an app while streaming ... only 1 client can be served, which is not good when
          used on a server for even a small group of users
        </li>
        <li>code that's comprised of giant <b>for</b> loops</li>
        <li>tons of conditional statements (if's/else's) ... zero OO skills</li>
        <li>bookmarklet, <em>nuff</em> said</li>
        <li>
          doing all of the above in one app, is little more than a fascination with
          the <em>tried and abandoned</em> ... as if that's original
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 9, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      the beauty of Ruby and what almost no one understands ... simplified:
      <blockquote>
        - <b>1.class</b> means <b>1</b> is an <b>object</b> whose <b>class</b> is Fixnum<br>
        - <b>Fixnum.instance_methods(false)</b> reveals this object to have these methods [:to_s, :+, :-, :==, etc], so<br>
        - <b>1.to_s</b> is really 1.send(:to_s) and <b>1 + 1</b> is really 1.send(:+, 1)<br>
        - yes, <b>send</b> is just passing a <b>message</b> to an <b>object</b><br>
        - of course, I don't need to know about <em>sending messages to objects</em> just to do <b>1 + 1</b><br>
        absolute beauty and why I say it's <b>manna from heaven</b>, ok, actually Japan
      </blockquote>
      but is it more beautiful to have a language like Smalltalk with only 6 keywords and no conditionals ... true OO
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      can't remember where I got these but every developer should be more:
      <ul>
        <li>Smalltalk infected</li>
        <li>Condition (if/else/case) averse</li>
        <li>Message centric<br>
          - don't own the behavoir of an object<br>
          - null object pattern<br>
          - composition ... beware of always using inheritance, it's not for sharing behavoir<br>
          - independency injection for behavior
        </li>
        <li>Abstraction seeking</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      another hot day, but it's the weekend and that's <em>my time</em> ... what to do today ?
      <br>
      turn on wifi, sit out on my new porch, and do some reading/research or watch conference videos ?
      <br>
      watch the grass grow, do nothing ? ... nothing is really something
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 8, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      at last the screening of the porch is done, both cats/skeeters hate it, I love it
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      the usual home/person chores plus 8 hours of programming every day, need a vacation
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      while I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's, all sorts of projects but mostly camera oriented,
      and they're great fun, it's become annoying to see/hear everyone repeat the <b>hype</b>
      that it only costs $35
      <br>
      it's NOT true:
        <ol>
          <li>shipping and handling</li>
          <li>it arrives and you unbox something that doesn't do anything</li>
          <li>no power supply</li>
          <li>no monitor</li>
          <li>no keyboard</li>
          <li>no mouse</li>
        </ol>
        all of the above cost extra money, so you're far closer to $100+ than $35
        <br>
        why does everyone continue to repeat <em>it only costs $35</em> ?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 7, 2015</h3>

    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      the Avengers movie was <em>ok</em>, who doesn't like watching the black widow jump around
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">a bit more work left on the porch today</li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      drove 30 miles yesterday to get a burger and banana shake at a <em>drive in</em>, you know,
      one of those places where you sit in your car and eat ... they still have those around here
      <br>
      the doctor would probably not like the idea of eating <em>drive in</em> food,
      but life's short so enjoy it sometimes
      <br>
      oh yeah, the banana shake actually had a real ripened banana in it ... it was oh so good
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      <a href="https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby" target="_blank">google-drive-ruby</a>
      looks interesting ...
      wonder how it compares to python's
      <a href="https://github.com/burnash/gspread" target="_blank">gspread</a> in terms of reliability
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 6, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      research what's involved with <b>updating</b> documents in elasticsearch and how
      <br>
      such an action may affect a large amount of data
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      bought some expensive plexiglass for the entrance to the porch to keep out the rain
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      the neighbor's cat, aka my pets, as I feed/play with them, do not like the screened in porch
      <br>
      there was much meowing and pacing
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      saw the doctor this morning about starting a more aggressive treatment of diabetes
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      maybe see the Avengers movie this evening as movies here are $5
      <br>
      to think I read comics growing up and now almost all of them are movies
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 5, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      yesterday was hot/humid, so I only finished one side of the porch ... two to go
      <br>
      probably should only work in the morning, which is possible now as I figured out
      a way to not use the noisy saw as much, don't want to disturb the neighborhood
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">very little time spent on the computers yesterday, sweet</li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">my very old neighbor, well, older than me, keeps visiting and retelling the same stories</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 4, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      discoverd <a href="http://riemann.io/" target="_blank">Riemann</a> over the weekend ...
      looks interesting so far, as does
      <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jcnc/2012/192913/" target="_blank">Holt-Winters anomaly detection</a>
      <br>
      anomaly detection, even with machine learning, is a <em>tough nut</em> in ids/ips
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      tired of <em>making fire</em> so must buy a gas bbq grill for chicken thighs, hamburgers, hot dogs, and veggies from the garden
      <br>
      sure, things won't taste as good as cooked over a fire, but <em>turning a knob and pressing a button</em> is so instantly gratifying
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      must finish screening in the porch, to sit outside without the skeeters eating me alive
      <br>
      maybe sleep out there at night, but I don't think <em>screen</em> is <b>bear</b> proof
      <br>
      hopefully I don't staple/hammer one of the neighbor's cats as they like to participate any time
      I'm outside doing stuff
      <br>
      ... they're totally useless coz all they do is rub up against your legs or lay down on the hammer
      <br>
      ... cats around here aren't afraid of cars, they stand in front of mine or get underneath,
      they cross the street without looking both ways ... I've warned them
      <br>
      once the porch is done I can enjoy a view of the surrounding mountains
      ... a joy after many years of living in SF/NY/DC with way too many people
      <br>
      or just stare at the neighbors as they back stare at me, lots of staring and waving around here
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 3, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Officially deprecate and stop all development on the
      <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/cellipede" target="_blank">Cellipede project</a>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      prepare the hummingbird feeders ... they're fun to watch and cool with the whole torpor thing they do
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 2, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      As the weather is supposed to be nice, I'm keeping computer time to a minimum and
      spending the day outside doing boring yard work.
      <br />
      Maybe even finish screening the porch before those skeeters arrive ... I think next
      week is the start of a heat wave.
      <br />
      Well, I'm off to move heavy stuff around and buy some screws ... it seems I purchase
      more than I construct.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      With retirement just around the corner, less than 2 years now, I'm thinking of reversing
      how life is lived.
      <br>
      Try to spend more time each day physically moving around, walking/jogging/playing, and
      less time sitting in front of a computer.
      <br>
      Sure, I enjoy computers/programming but too much time with them is not healthy.
      <br>
      Growing up I was fidgety and always on the move, but once I discovered programming that changed.
      <br>
      I stopped running long distances and playing tennis which I was once good enough at to play in college.
      <br>
      Just thinking ... but I guess everyone thinks about returning to their youth sometimes.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 1, 2015</h3>
  May is here and we're springing into summer, so some spring clean up is needed.
  <ul>
    <li>
      final ideas for Cellipede, but I probably won't implement these:
      <ul>
        <li>create a generic endpoint to handle any function</li>
        <li>the endpoint should behave like ruby's <b>method missing</b></li>
        <li>
          create a Cellipede api-only version just for function execution
          <br />
          with no UI, no javascript/html/css, no database
          ... this is easy due to the app's design, thank me :-)
          <br />
          ... just the function endpoints
          ... keeping it a small/fast code base (sinatra-like)
          ... and run it on Heroku
        </li>
        <li>
          use the above for other purposes than seo, it's dead remember, stuff
          ... just don't document the hidden functions so the app doesn't get abused yet I can use it
        </li>
        <li>add code to throttle requests avoiding HTTP DOS attacks</li>
        <li>
          all of the above just happens to coincide with the new features
          that are <em>coming soon</em> to Rails 5, which puts more emphasis
          on using rails as a back-end api server with Ember/whatever in front
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY" target="_blank">NLTK series</a>
      by sentdex has caught my eye, and his Scikit-learn series was great
      <br />
      ... it's refreshing to see good design/coding/testing even if he's not a professional programming
      but has invested the time to learn enough to do a great job with great videos
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      an idea for a new project came to me this morning, but I won't reveal it here
      <br />
      - it's always best to begin in a private github repo or local repo to avoid premature judgements,
      then, maybe, go public/open-source once somewhat sure
      <br />
      - a python/flask app
      <br />
      - just RESTful api, no UI, see:
      <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask" target="_blank">restful</a>
      or
      <a href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.2/index.html" target="_blank">flask-restful</a>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      my Amazon Fire TV arrived today, and I could do a useless <em>unboxing video</em> but I'll
      leave that to the advertising/marketing types
      <br />
      - it works great, almost as small as a Raspberry Pi
      <br />
      - maybe, at last, I can cut the cable company cord, well, for TV at least
      <br />
      - <em>knock on wood</em>, but this area has the fastest internet service I've ever experienced,
      and that includes D.C. and New York city and other places that I have lived before
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;... it's amazing and I wonder why, maybe, being in the mountains
      we have the <em>high ground</em>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      spent some time learning about Action Cable and websockets coming in Rails 5 ... interesting
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      in the evening's twilight, I sat on the porch and shot my pistol and rifle at some rain drops,
      not sure I hit any, but
      it's fun to aim at stuff ... I'm not a hunter unless going to Food Lion counts, I just
      like aiming at stuff (not animals)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Apr 30, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      create a python/scapy daemon to watch/count recurring hosts/ips within a given timeframe
      <br />
      this will see all hosts/ips on the nic and not just the ones that match a signature in snort/suricata
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>April 11, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      revive Uni2Espy on github: https://github.com/cleesmith/uni2espy
      <br />
      which processes unified2 files from snort/suricata/whatever and indexes them into Elasticsearch
