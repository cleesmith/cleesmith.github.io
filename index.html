<h2 class="section-heading">a dear friend passes &nbsp;<small>Monday, March 27, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Last week a dear friend past away. I miss her. I will miss her crazy emails and text messages.
  She was an internet friend, if that counts as friendship ... to me it's a bit like the 
  old days where people expressed unrequited love by writing letters and sending them through the mail.
  We only met in person twice for coffee. Both times were a bit awkward, as is usually the 
  case for me. There's something about sitting in front of someone's animated face that 
  can be off-putting. I assisted with her funeral arrangements, as I had 
  promised her I would do, because her big family disowned her many years ago.
  Forgiveness can be a tough nut. She dealt with cancer for many years, not really 
  clinging to life but going with the flow.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">blogging, yet again &nbsp;<small>Monday, February 20, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
It has been a long time since I've updated this blog so here goes.
Using github.io makes this blog cost nothing ($0) for anyone with a github account (also free).
If you don't mind a domain name like <a href="https://cleesmith.github.io/" target="_blank">cleesmith.github.io</a> 
then it's totally free.
One could also use a custom domain, as explained
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h2 class="section-heading">rant about websites</h2>
<blockquote><b>It is so damn annoying!</b></blockquote>
<p>
Why are there so many websites where the <b>meat</b> of the page is totally surrounded by ad's,
tiny videos, <i>follow us</i>, and other annoying garbage?  I guess the "word" is
not as powerful as we've been told.
We actually came to their page to read the article, and not to be bombarded by ad's, pop-up's, or whatever.
It gets worse as you scroll down while reading -- <b>pop up's</b> occur or videos start playing or
the page refreshes parts of itself and becomes unresponsive.
My usual reaction is to immediately close the page. Yes, I will not follow, nor like, nor participate 
  in such annoying nonsense ... usually the content on such websites is totally useless.
There should be a web browser setting that can only load the <b>readable text</b> on a page and nothing else.
You know, like the old days of the internet.
Ok, I found <a href="http://www.textise.net/" target="_blank">Textise</a> which is slow but makes annoying websites more readable.

<h2 class="section-heading">Health &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 30, 2016</small></h2>
<p>
<span>
  The two biggest health problems are <b>chance</b> and <b>time</b>.
  By <b>chance</b> I mean one may be predisposed to certain illnesses, it's just the
  luck (bad luck) of the draw.
  By <b>time</b> I mean everything happens so slowly as to be almost imperceptable.
  We suck at observing the small and slow changes that occur to our bodies.
  We seem to only notice things just after they have happened -- like noticing you are 
  over 40 years old and suddenly you need reading glasses. As a voracious reader 
  that was a bad day.
  <br />
  It always seems to be a <b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
<span>Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.</span>
<span>Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.</span>
<span>After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.</span>
<span>You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.</span>
<br /><br />
<span>When it comes to calories, life is not fair.</span>
<span>
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting so much and focus on the quality of what you eat and eat less of it.
</span>
</p>

<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<p>
<span>Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.</span>
<br />
<span>There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.</span>
<br /><br />
<span>If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.</span>
<span>For example <b>-- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts --</b> these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.</span>
<span>Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have a beer belly too.</span>
</p>

<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<p>
<span>Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.</span>
<span>In fact, we do not need to eat any carbohydrates, but fruit is nice sometimes.</span>
<span>Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.</span>
<br /><br />
<span>Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.</span>
<span>Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.</span>
</p>

<h3>Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.<br /><small>Hippocrates</small></h3><br />
