<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
<span class=sntc>Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.</span>
<span class=sntc>Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.</span>
<span class=sntc>After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.</span>
<span class=sntc>You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class=sntc>When it comes to calories, life is not fair.</span>
<span class=sntc>
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting so much and focus on the quality of what you eat and eat less of it.
</span>
</p>

<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<p>
<span class=sntc>Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.</span>
<br />
<span class=sntc>There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class=sntc>If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.</span>
<span class=sntc>For example <b>-- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts --</b> these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.</span>
<span class=sntc>Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have a beer belly too.</span>
</p>

<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<p>
<span class=sntc>Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.</span>
<span class=sntc>Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.</span>
<br /><br />
<span class=sntc>Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.</span>
<span class=sntc>Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.</span>
</p>

<h3>Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.<br /><small>Hippocrates</small></h3><br />

<h2 class="section-heading">First Fast</h2>
<p>
<span class=sntc>After fasting for 40 hours I lost two pounds.</span>
<span class=sntc>That's impressive, and it really wasn't that hard.</span>
<span class=sntc>Of course, the thing about weight loss is keeping it off.</span>
<span class=sntc>Alas, I did eat too much after breaking the fast, which is only natural I think.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=sntc>It helped to distract myself by going on a day trip.</span>
<span class=sntc>So I visited <a href="http://www.boxerwood.org/" target="_blank">Boxerwood</a> in Lexington, Virginia.</span>
<span class=sntc>It's a free arboretum to walk and play around in, which was once the home of a local doctor (MD)
who had a fondness for growing trees.</span>
<span class=sntc>Mostly it seems aimed at city kid's education about nature in a fairie tale like setting.</span>
<span class=sntc>But I found it interesting and lingered for a few hours as the day was sunny with a cool breeze.</span>
<span class=sntc>Some years March, April, and May can have perfect weather.</span>
<span class=sntc>I would like to go back again and take some photos and maybe a video.</span>
<span class=sntc>There were turtles, birds, and lots of trees that don't belong in Virginia.</span>
<span class=sntc>I spoke with a pretty woman who worked there as a childrens educator.</span>
<span class=sntc>She talked about Boxerwood and showed me where the crypt was located.</span>
<span class=sntc>As is my habit, and too often my downfall, I fall in love with just about every woman I meet.</span>
<span class=sntc>What's up with that?</span>
<span class=sntc>And, yes, some of the Munger family are buried on the site.</span>
<span class=sntc>Further, there is an area at the back of Boxerwood with a plaque describing interments.</span>
<span class=sntc>Apparently, future "natural" burials <i>(you know, like a body farm, perhaps not that extreme)</i> are planned in that location.</span>
<span class=sntc>It seemed out of place and a bit creepy.</span>
<span class=sntc>An overall impression that I got was a place with Wiccan/witch overtones.</span>
<span class=sntc>Maybe that is just due to my experiences with wiccan girlfriends over the years.</span>
<span class=sntc>For me, it just made the place all the more interesting.</span>
<span class=sntc>And if you are trying to elude evil spirits then there's a
<a href="http://www.rothteien.com/archives/myths/zigzag.htm" target="_blank">zig zag bridge</a>,
which may or may not help.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Things Have Changed</h2>
<p>
<span class=sntc>Just about finished with my first deliberate fast.</span>
<span class=sntc>It is only a 36 hour fast, just to see how the old body does.</span>
<span class=sntc>I dropped a pound, so far, which isn't the whole point of fasting really.</span>
<span class=sntc>It seems that a pound a day is typical, well, at first anyways.</span>
<span class=sntc>Our bodies seem to do at least one thing very well, and that is adapt to changes.</span>
<span class=sntc>As if there is some built in mechanism to seek equilibrium (as in stasis).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=sntc>I have gone without food before, just not with a purpose in mind.</span>
<span class=sntc>Twice in my life I have gone seven or more days without food.</span>
<span class=sntc>Once was a silly bet with a friend, but I passed out on the seventh day after standing up too fast from sitting on the toilet.</span>
<span class=sntc>Let's face it, the very last place you want your body to be found is near a toilet.</span>
<span class=sntc>Especially if you didn't get the chance to flush.</span>
<span class=sntc>The second time I went without food was hiking the Appalachian Trail.</span>
<span class=sntc>I made it eight days without anything but water.</span>
<span class=sntc>One time I drank unfilter puddle water, now that's thirsty and a bit humbling.</span>
<span class=sntc>It was difficult, and due to bad planning on my part, and it was the longest period of time while hiking that I didn't encounter another person.</span>
<span class=sntc>Just my luck, no guardian angel appeared.</span>
<span class=sntc>Of course, after doing some research, lot's of people fast for longer periods of time.</span>
<span class=sntc>So I guess my experience was not such a big deal after all, but it sure felt like it at the time.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span class=sntc>Why am I fasting?</span>
<span class=sntc>Well, I have diabetes type 2 and I am still a bit over weight.</span>
<span class=sntc>My hope is that fasting will help to control insulin and lose some weight.</span>
<span class=sntc>Time will tell.</span>
<span class=sntc>After all of these years I am only now learning to listen to my body.</span>
<span class=sntc>Sure, we all age, and we all break.</span>
<span class=sntc>My personal theory is that all of us only get so many heart beats.</span>
<span class=sntc>I just want to feel better and lessen my food obsession while enjoying my remaining heart beats.</span>

<h2 class="section-heading">rants</h2>
<p>
<span class=sntc>Why are there so many websites where the <b>meat</b> of the page is totally surrounded by ad's, tiny videos, <i>follow us</i>, and so on?</span>
<span class=sntc>We actually came to their page to read the article, and not to be bombarded by ad's, pop-up's, or whatever.</span>
<span class=sntc>It gets worse as you scroll down while reading -- <b>pop up's</b> occur or videos start playing or the page refreshes parts of itself and becomes unresponsive.</span>
<span class=sntc>It is so annoying!
<span class=sntc>Wordpress is absolutely evil.</span>
<span class=sntc>My usual reaction is to immediately close the page.</span>
<span class=sntc>There should be a web browser setting that can only load the <b>readable text</b> on a page and nothing else.</span>
<span class=sntc>You know, like the old days of the internet.</span>
<span class=sntc>Ok, I found <a href="http://www.textise.net/" target="_blank">Textise</a> which is slow but makes annoying websites more readable.</span>
</p>

<hr />
<p>
<span class=sntc>The biggest health problem is <b>time</b>.</span>
<span class=sntc>By that I mean everything happens so slowly as to be almost imperceptable.</span>
<span class=sntc>We humans suck at observing the small and slow changes that occur to our bodies.</span>
<span class=sntc>We seem to only notice things at the end -- like noticing you are over 40 years old when suddenly you need reading glasses.</span>
<span class=sntc>It always seems to be a <b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.</span>
