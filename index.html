          It's time to focus on other projects and not Cellipede, as there seems to be little interest in SEO apps

            A pre-installed Python development environment in Tiny Core for use on Windows with QEMU or VirtualBox.
            <br />
            This includes: python/pip, compile tools, openssh, vim/nano, and git.
            <br />
            It is a perfect way to <em>get your feet wet</em> and begin learning Linux/Python, or
            just use it to explore apps like Cellipede.
            <br />
            If you are just curious, this avoids wasting time and suffering through installing all of that python related software.

  <h3>May 1, 2015</h3>
  May is here and we're springing into summer, so some spring clean up is needed.
  <blockquote>
    Let's resolve to think only of interesting things, not fan the flames of the vain, and
    ignore them and their projects.
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      final ideas for Cellipede, but I probably won't implement these:
      <ul>
        <li>create a generic endpoint to handle any function</li>
        <li>the endpoint should behave like ruby's <b>method missing</b></li>
        <li>
          create a Cellipede api-only version just for function execution
          <br />
          with no UI, no javascript/html/css, no database
          ... this is easy due to the app's design, thank me :-)
          <br />
          ... just the function endpoints
          ... keeping it a small/fast code base (sinatra-like)
          ... and run it on Heroku
        </li>
        <li>
          use the above for other purposes than seo, it's dead remember, stuff
          ... just don't document the hidden functions so the app doesn't get abused yet I can use it
        </li>
        <li>add code to throttle requests avoiding HTTP DOS attacks</li>
        <li>
          all of the above just happens to coincide with the new features
          that are <em>coming soon</em> to Rails 5, which puts more emphasis
          on using rails as a back-end api server with Ember/whatever in front
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY" target="_blank">NLTK series</a>
      by sentdex has caught my eye, and his Scikit-learn series was great
      <br />
      ... it's refreshing to see good design/coding/testing even if he's not a professional programming
      but has invested the time to learn enough to do a great job with great videos
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      an idea for a new project came to me this morning, but I won't reveal it here
      <br />
      - it's always best to begin in a private github repo or local repo to avoid premature judgements,
      then, maybe, go public/open-source once somewhat sure
      <br />
      - a python/flask app
      <br />
      - just RESTful api, no UI, see:
      <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask" target="_blank">restful</a>
      or
      <a href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.2/index.html" target="_blank">flask-restful</a>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      my Amazon Fire TV arrived today, and I could do a useless <em>unboxing video</em> but I'll
      leave that to the lesser advertising/marketing types
      <br />
      - it works greats, almost as small as a Raspberry Pi
      <br />
      - maybe, at last, I can cut the cable company cord, well, for TV at least
      <br />
      - <em>knock on wood</em>, but this area has the fastest internet service I've ever experienced,
      and that includes D.C. and New York city and other places that I have lived before
      ... it's amazing and I wonder why, maybe, being in the mountains it's all down hill from here
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      sat on the porch and shot my pistol and rifle at some rain drops, not sure I hit any, but
      it's fun to aim at stuff ... I'm not a hunter unless going to Food Lion counts, I just
      like aiming at stuff (not animals)
    </li>

  <h3>Apr 30, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      create a python/scapy daemon to watch/count recurring hosts/ips within a given timeframe
      <br />
      this will see all hosts/ips on the nic and not just the ones that match a signature in snort/suricata
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>April 11, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      revive Uni2Espy on github: https://github.com/cleesmith/uni2espy
      <br />
      which processes unified2 files from snort/suricata/whatever and indexes them into Elasticsearch
    </li>
  </ul>
