I managed a book store in the evening as a second 
job for a few years,long ago when such things were commonplace, so this popped into my head: 
"Standing with my back against shelves of books i 
have never
read and never will, i start to speak.  The tiny 
crowd coughs and
adjusts while trying to get comfortable in those 
metal folding chairs.
Over eager eyes stare back, hanging on every 
uttered syllable.  As if i speak anywhere near as 
well as i write.  Writing takes time and only comes 
out of growth.  Speaking is in the now with no 
chance to edit. No do-overs. I begin as usual with 
the giving of credit where credit is due.  Always 
saying that someone named Linda gifted me a wind up 
tomato shaped timer gadget which spawned a 
seemingly never ending series of books.  Each one 
a best seller, a light in the 
dark, life changing, songs were sung, wine and 
cheese was served, yadda yadda yadda." ...
