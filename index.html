          Most of my projects are crafted using Ruby <small>(manna from heaven)</small>,
          Python <small>(lesser manna)</small>,
          C <small>(no manna)</small>,
          and Java <small>(the opposite of manna)</small>

            A pre-installed Python development environment in Tiny Core for use on Windows with QEMU or VirtualBox.
            <br />
            This includes: python/pip, compile tools, openssh, vim/nano, and git.
            <br />
            It is a perfect way to <em>get your feet wet</em> and begin learning Linux/Python, or
            just use it to explore apps like Cellipede.
            <br />
            If you are just curious, this avoids wasting time and suffering through installing all of that python related software.

          I prefer writing using just plain ole html, and not some javascript markdown thingie
          <br />
          while I like markdown, I'll leave that for documenting github projects
          <br />
          it's nice to stay in touch with a piece from the <em>big bang of the internet</em> ... H T M L
          <br />
          ok, I threw in some twitter bootstrap, it's cool
          <br />
          as you may have noticed, I do not consider myself a writer, well, at least not the
          type to write long diatribes containing techno babble as if trying to impress beyond their means
          and feebly attempting to <em>pied pipe</em> the masses
          <br />
          I'll stick with brief words, maybe not even sentences, about doings, thoughts, tasks, and what not

  <h3>May 4, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      discoverd <a href="http://riemann.io/" target="_blank">Riemann</a> over the weekend ...
      looks interesting so far, as does
      <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jcnc/2012/192913/" target="_blank">Holt-Winters anomaly detection</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      tired of <em>making fire</em> so must buy a gas bbq grill for chicken thighs, hamburgers, hot dogs, and veggies from the garden
      <br>
      sure, things won't taste as good as cooked over a fire, but <em>turning a knob and pressing a button</em> is so instant gratification
    </li>
    <li>
      must finish screening in the porch, to sit outside without the skeeters eating me alive
      <br>
      maybe sleep out there at night, but I don't think <em>screen</em> is <b>bear</b> proof
      <br>
      hopefully I don't staple/hammer one of the neighbor's cats as they like to participate any time
      I'm outside doing stuff
      <br>
      ... they're totally useless coz all they do is rub up against your legs or lay down on the hammer
      <br>
      ... cats around here aren't afraid of cars, they stand in front of mine or get underneath,
      they cross the street without looking both ways ... I've warned them
      <br>
      once the porch is done I can enjoy a view of the surrounding mountains
      ... a joy after many years of living in SF/NY/DC with way too many people
      <br>
      or just stare at the neighbors as they back stare at me, lots of staring and waving around here
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 3, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Officially deprecate and stop all development on the
      <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/cellipede" target="_blank">Cellipede project</a>
    </li>
    <li>prepare the hummingbird feeders</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>May 2, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      As the weather is supposed to be nice, I'm keeping computer time to a minimum and
      spending the day outside doing boring yard work.
      <br />
      Maybe even finish screening the porch before those skeeters arrive ... I think next
      week is the start of a heat wave.
      <br />
      Well, I'm off to move heavy stuff around and buy some screws ... it seems I purchase
      more than I construct.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      With retirement just around the corner, less than 2 years now, I'm thinking of reversing
      how life is lived.
      <br>
      Try to spend more time each day physically moving around, walking/jogging/playing, and
      less time sitting in front of a computer.
      <br>
      Sure, I enjoy computers/programming but too much time with them is not healthy.
      <br>
      Growing up I was fidgety and always on the move, but once I discovered programming that changed.
      <br>
      I stopped running long distances and playing tennis which I was once good enough at to play in college.
      <br>
      Just thinking ... but I guess everyone thinks about returning to their youth sometimes.

  <h3>May 1, 2015</h3>
  May is here and we're springing into summer, so some spring clean up is needed.
  <blockquote>
    Let's resolve to think only of interesting things, not fan the flames of the vain, and
    ignore them and their projects.
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      final ideas for Cellipede, but I probably won't implement these:
      <ul>
        <li>create a generic endpoint to handle any function</li>
        <li>the endpoint should behave like ruby's <b>method missing</b></li>
        <li>
          create a Cellipede api-only version just for function execution
          <br />
          with no UI, no javascript/html/css, no database
          ... this is easy due to the app's design, thank me :-)
          <br />
          ... just the function endpoints
          ... keeping it a small/fast code base (sinatra-like)
          ... and run it on Heroku
        </li>
        <li>
          use the above for other purposes than seo, it's dead remember, stuff
          ... just don't document the hidden functions so the app doesn't get abused yet I can use it
        </li>
        <li>add code to throttle requests avoiding HTTP DOS attacks</li>
        <li>
          all of the above just happens to coincide with the new features
          that are <em>coming soon</em> to Rails 5, which puts more emphasis
          on using rails as a back-end api server with Ember/whatever in front
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY" target="_blank">NLTK series</a>
      by sentdex has caught my eye, and his Scikit-learn series was great
      <br />
      ... it's refreshing to see good design/coding/testing even if he's not a professional programming
      but has invested the time to learn enough to do a great job with great videos
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      an idea for a new project came to me this morning, but I won't reveal it here
      <br />
      - it's always best to begin in a private github repo or local repo to avoid premature judgements,
      then, maybe, go public/open-source once somewhat sure
      <br />
      - a python/flask app
      <br />
      - just RESTful api, no UI, see:
      <a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask" target="_blank">restful</a>
      or
      <a href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.2/index.html" target="_blank">flask-restful</a>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      my Amazon Fire TV arrived today, and I could do a useless <em>unboxing video</em> but I'll
      leave that to the advertising/marketing types
      <br />
      - it works great, almost as small as a Raspberry Pi
      <br />
      - maybe, at last, I can cut the cable company cord, well, for TV at least
      <br />
      - <em>knock on wood</em>, but this area has the fastest internet service I've ever experienced,
      and that includes D.C. and New York city and other places that I have lived before
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;... it's amazing and I wonder why, maybe, being in the mountains
      we have the <em>high ground</em>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      spent some time learning about Action Cable and websockets coming in Rails 5 ... interesting
    </li>
    <li style="margin-top:10px;">
      in the evening's twilight, I sat on the porch and shot my pistol and rifle at some rain drops,
      not sure I hit any, but
      it's fun to aim at stuff ... I'm not a hunter unless going to Food Lion counts, I just
      like aiming at stuff (not animals)
    </li>

  <h3>Apr 30, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      create a python/scapy daemon to watch/count recurring hosts/ips within a given timeframe
      <br />
      this will see all hosts/ips on the nic and not just the ones that match a signature in snort/suricata
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>April 11, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      revive Uni2Espy on github: https://github.com/cleesmith/uni2espy
      <br />
      which processes unified2 files from snort/suricata/whatever and indexes them into Elasticsearch
    </li>
