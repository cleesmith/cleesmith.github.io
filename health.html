<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.
</p>
<h4>
  When it comes to calories, life is not fair.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting numbers and focus on the quality of what you eat.
</h4><br />
<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<h4>
  Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.
  <br />
  There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.
</h4><br />
<h4>
  If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  For example -- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts -- these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have
  a beer belly too.
</h4><br />
<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<h4>
  Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.
</h4><br />
<h4>
  Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.

<h2 class="section-heading">Things Have Changed</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>All I can do is be me, whoever that is<br /><small>Bob Dylan</small></blockquote>
Just about finished with my first deliberate fast.
&nbsp;
It is only a 36 hour fast, just to see how the old body does.
&nbsp;
I dropped a pound, so far, which isn't the point really.
&nbsp;
It seems that a pound a day is typical, well, at first anyways.
&nbsp;
Our bodies seem to do at least one thing very well, and that is adapt to changes.
&nbsp;
As if there is some built in mechanism to seek equilibrium (as in stasis).
&nbsp;
I have gone without food before, just not with a purpose in mind.
&nbsp;
Twice in my life I have gone seven or more days without food.
&nbsp;
Once was a silly bet with a friend, but I passed out on the seventh day after
standing up too fast from sitting on the toilet.
&nbsp;
Let's face it, the very last place you want your body to be found is near a toilet.
&nbsp;
Especially if you didn't get the chance to flush.
&nbsp;
The second time I went without food was hiking the Appalachian Trail.
&nbsp;
I made it eight days without anything but water.
&nbsp;
One time I drank unfilter puddle water, now that's thirsty.
&nbsp;
It was difficult, and due to bad planning on my part, and it was longest period of time
while hiking that I didn't encounter another person.
&nbsp;
Just my luck.
&nbsp;
Of course, after doing some research, lot's of people fast for longer periods of time.
So I guess my experience was not such a big deal after all, but it sure felt like at the time.
</p>
<p>
Why am I fasting?
&nbsp;
Well, I have diabetes type 2 and I am still a bit over weight.
&nbsp;
My hope is that fasting will help to control insulin and lose some weight.
&nbsp;
Time will tell.
&nbsp;
After all of these years I am only now learning to listen to my body.
&nbsp;
Sure, we all age, and we all break.
&nbsp;
My personal theory is that all of us only get so many heart beats.
&nbsp;
I just want to feel better and not have food be such an obsession while enjoying my remaining heart beats.
</p>
<blockquote>All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie<br /><small>Bob Dylan</small></blockquote>

<h2 class="section-heading">mini rant</h2>
<p>
Why are there so many websites where the <b>meat</b> of the page is totally surrounded
by ad's, tiny videos, <i>follow us</i>, and so on? We actually came to their
page to read the article, and not to be bombarded by ad's, pop-up's, or whatever. It
gets worse as you scroll down while reading -- <b>pop up's</b> occur or videos start
playing or the page refreshes parts of itself and becomes unresponsive.
It is so annoying! Wordpress is absolutely evil. My usual reaction is to immediately
close the page. There should be a web browser setting that can only load the
<b>readable text</b> on a page and nothing else. You know, like the old days of
the internet. Ok, I found <a href="http://www.textise.net/" target="_blank">Textise</a>
which is slow but makes annoying websites more readable.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Latest Epiphany</h2>
<p>
I have noticed a weight loss trend. When I skip exercising for a day or two, the
the scale reads less. It's almost always about 2 pounds lost. Why? I have no idea.
Sometimes it even goes down despite eating more calories on those <b>off</b> days.
Again, why? Again, I have no idea.
There must be a reason behind this phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
While I don't really believe in following any of the fad diets, like paleo or low carb
high fat, it seems I do eat more fat than any other macronutrient.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_macronutrients" target="_blank">Macronutrients</a>
is just a fancy word for the bulky stuff we eat -- like carbohydrates, protein, and fats. Note
that I am ignoring alcohol, as we don't really need that. I think the attraction to fat
is similar to our attraction to sweets. It's natural to find things with an
abundance of <b>energy</b> attractive. After all, we need energy to stay alive.
</p>
<p>
Also, I am considering giving fasting a try. It's just those hunger pangs that give
me pause. I know I can do it. But is it really worth it in the long term? Does fasting
really alter the body's <b>equilibrium</b> (or set point) so that weight is not
regained?
</p>
<p>
The biggest health problem is <b>time</b>. By that I mean everything happens so slowly
as to be almost imperceptable. We humans suck at observing the small and slow changes
that occur to our bodies. We seem to only notice things at the end -- like noticing you
are over 40 years old when suddenly you need reading glasses. It always seems to be a
<b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Sunday Weigh In</h2>
<p>
To be honest, I am a bit <i>old school</i> when it comes to the day of the week called <b>Sunday</b>.
It tends to be a day where I don't focus on anything. I do no work. I pay no attention to diet or
exercise. It is pretty much a day about <b>feelings</b>, as in I do what I feel like doing or
nothing at all. I think this is true for a lot of people. It may not be a Sunday for everyone
but it seems common for everyone to have a <i>down day</i>. Often times I think about the past.
Mostly my thoughts are about feelings; like regrets. A waste of time, really, but it is a recurring
pattern that seems to occur naturally. So I don't worry about it and just go with the flow.
</p>
<p>
Sunday is also the day where I tend to take notice of my weight. Today I weigh 189 pounds. A year
ago I would have weighed about 270 pounds. That's a lot of weight to lose in one year. For the
most part the loss is due to walking everyday and eating better. By <i>eating better</i> I mean
eating less calories per day, less carbohydrates, drinking no milk or sodas (like Coke),
more vegetables, and only drinking water and coffee (suppresses the appetite).
My blood sugar levels are almost normal, so type 2 diabetes is definitely influenced by body
weight. However, I am still haunted by urges to eat breads and cheeses. I love them. Both are
calorie dense. Eating bread is a bit like eating sugar, so I try to limit my intake. But this has
not been easy, as I love sandwiches, as in any and all sandwiches.
</p>
<p>
However, I have been hovering around 189 pounds for several months now. Even limiting my calorie
intake to 1,400 calories per day has not resulted in further weight loss. This must be one
of those dreaded plateaus you read about. So I am not sure what to do next. Perhaps it is enough
to be happy and content with the fact that I have lost a lot of weight and I have made some important
life style changes. In other words, don't push myself too much, rather <i>cut myself a break</i> and
let time do it's thing. As long as I am not gaining weight, I think maintaining weight is a good thing.
I am definitely stronger and more flexible. For someone who was once a macho sports nut this may sound
odd, but I have been doing some
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_8Di3Gdifhh0CJ5QV7JxqA" target="_blank">ballet</a>
exercises. I can feel the difference in the <i>core muscles</i> of my body and I am more flexible. I
can bend over and place my palms on the floor. Of course, it doesn't hurt to watch someone that
beautiful doing exercises.
</p>
<p>
Another approach that may help to lose more weight is to <b>up the exercise</b> level. I just worry
about going overboard and causing an injury which would actually lead to less exercise. I have a
known tendency to go overboard ... such as falling in love with just about every woman I meet. We
all have flaws, I guess, and love is not such a bad one to have.
Many years ago I use to run six or more miles everyday. Three miles in the morning and three miles
in the evening. But what I remember most, other than being in <i>great shape appearance wise</i>,
is that I was always tired and sore. All of those years of running also did some damage to the
<a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/chondromalacia-patella#Overview1" target="_blank">
area under my left knee cap</a>. So I am really trying to avoid running again. I have tried
jogging for about a quarter of a mile on some days without any extra soreness in my knee. My
knee is always sore, but not overwhelmingly so. Mostly I only notice the soreness when trying to
go to sleep. Maybe I will try to mix in some jogging with walking to burn some extra calories in
a shorter amount of time. Walking long distances is very time consuming. Spending all of that
time in an upright position sometimes causes my back to ache. Perhaps I have bad posture, I am
not sure.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Sweet Jane Maybe</h2>
<p>
Reading and writing is an addiction. Good or bad? I can spend hours doing it. Perhaps it will become
an all consuming thing in retirement. A dilemma too perhaps as there is too much of it for one life time.
Nowadays it is even worst with blogs and instant publishing
-- think <a href="https://medium.com/@cleesmith/pen-and-paper-health-fb3329f66259" target="_blank">medium</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">No More Local Tomatoes</h2>
<p>
It is the fall, here in Virginia, and that means canned tomatoes. I sometimes like
<i>Cento San Marzano Certified Peeled Tomatoes</i> when local ones are no longer available.
They probably come from anywhere but Italy. They taste ok. But the
<i>Muir Glen Organic Whole Peeled Tomatoes</i> taste better, to me.
<span class="caption text-muted">
Italy might be a tad overrated. A romantic notion, really, even among tomatoes.
</span>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Pen and Paper</h2>
<p>
Update: published this on <a href="https://medium.com/@cleesmith/pen-and-paper-health-fb3329f66259" target="_blank">medium</a>.
<br>
Another good habit that has been key to losing weight and feeling better is counting calories.
I bought a cheap, small notebook and sharpie pen to keep in the kitchen near where I eat.
Don't bother counting the exact calorie intake, read the label and round up the number a bit.
So each day I have a record of what I ate and about how many calories consumed. I have tried to stay
within 1,400 to 1,800 each day. Some days I am more hungry than others. So far this has
worked great, as I have lost 1-2 pounds per week -- losing 70 pounds since
May 2015. Now, that is probably too much too fast, but I think it is typical to lose
more when first starting new diet and exercise habits. So I am prepared for this
to become more difficult and slower as time goes on.
<span class="caption text-muted">
There is no getting around the fact that <b>calories consumed</b> dictate <b>your weight</b> -- it's the plain, simple, truth.
</span>
Because I have diabetes type 2, I do limit the carbs I eat per day. Also, buy some
dumbbells, like 10-15 pounds, and do some repetitions every other day. No, you
don't have to look like the Rock(Dwayne Johnson), but it will help with fat
burning as well being less flabby as you lose weight. Don't over do it with
the dumbbells, as a little goes a long way -- especially at first.
</p>
<p>
Buy one of those pedometers that you clip on your shoe, and shoot for
5,000 (2 miles = 200 calories) to 10,000 (4 miles = 400 calories) steps every today.
It is not that the exercise really burns that many calories, but it will make
you feel better. Also, make a note of what you did each day in your notebook -- positive
feedback does help as silly as that sounds.
<span class="caption text-muted">
The power of suggestion or as quantum physics indicates observing something changes that something.
</span>
</p>
<p>
I recently got the results of a blood test from the doctor. And after doing all of the
aforementioned life changes, the results were amazing. My A1C, triglycerides, etc. are all back to normal.
This has all changed since the <i>way-over-the-top</i> readings back in mid May 2015.
I really did not believe that the suggestions of the doctor and nutritionist would actually work.
I've always believed that you had to exercise to near exhaustion, i.e. nauseated, every
day to get and stay in shape -- I had that runner's mentality.
</p>
<p>
But their suggestions have worked with just walking and paying attention to what I eat every day.
<span class="caption text-muted">Repeating these life style changes almost every day is the key to success.</span>
Both the doctor and nutritionist seemed very surprised that I actually listened and followed
their advice. Apparently most people do not. While most people probably want
to feel better, they just don't or can't make it a habit for some reason. Hopefully,
I don't backslide, as they say, too much -- although pizza is seriously calling my
name especially on Fridays, and sometimes there's a ringing sound of tacos from Taco Bell,
or one of those huge burritos from Chipotle -- a 1,200+ calorie behemoth with 100+ carbs,
which should come with a side order of heart bypass surgery or a coffin ... but they are so awesome.
<span class="caption text-muted">
Every now and then it is ok to cut yourself a break -- indulge for a day.
</span>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Odd Viewpoint Maybe</h2>
<p>
As odd as it is to say, having diabetes type-2 is kind of a blessing in disguise. WTF?
By that I mean if you pay attention while trying to lessen the effects of diabetes, you
can really get to know how "your" body works. For example, I use to run a lot and
since that burns tons of calories I did not really pay attention to what I was eating.
Like those pre-marathon dinners with huge amounts of pasta and spaghetti -- tasty but not
really good for a body. When I stopped running due to a knee injury (not serious just
too painful to run) and continued with the poor eating habits, guess what, you gain
weight. But worse your whole body goes whacky. My idea of exercise was running until
I wanted to puke. Manly -- right? -- wrong! It turns out that lesser exercises, such as
walking, really do have an effect on your body. Currently I'm walking from 4 to 6 miles
every day, and sometimes take a break on Sunday's -- i.e. a less exercise day allows for some recovery.
Who knew that using slow twitch muscles was exercise, after all we are designed to walk all day
long if our feet and back did not get sore. So walking never seemed like real exercise to me.
But after doing this for several months, my blood pressure is now within a normal range
and my blood sugar (with medication) is close to normal.
<span class="caption text-muted">
Overall, I feel much better and stronger.
</span>
I even learned a new programming called Go -- so my brain is working better too.
I have learned a lot about calories, carbohydrates, fats, and supermarkets. As for supermarkets,
most of the space is devoted to foods we should not eat. Like starches, which turn to sugar
almost the moment you swallow them, with nothing good in them for anyone. Sure pasta and mashed
potatoes taste great, just not great for you, but it is hard to turn down those traditional
foods during those holiday meals with family.
So it is all about being disciplined or giving in to feeling lousy and weak. It's all been
insightful and interesting.
The hard part will be making this new life style into a habit over the long haul, and given that
the diabetes horror stories are true that should be enough motivation. Who wants to go blind or
lose a leg or kidneys. Sure, as you get older things will break so diet and exercise are not
going to fix everything. But I think feeling better is a good thing, and so is a good nights sleep due in
large part to the exercise.
<span class="caption text-muted">
Feeling better is not the same as being happy. But what is happy?
</span>
<span class="caption text-muted">
As many have said before, <b>happy is something you decide to be</b> and not something you can find or
pursue -- silly declaration of independence.
</span>
<span class="caption text-muted">
So, for me, <b>happy it will be</b> while <b>feeling better</b> too.
</span>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The day is cold, and dark, and dreary...</h2>
<p>
At last, a rainy day. No walking today. Besides my feet are sore from all of the miles and miles.
They need a day off. Enjoy it. The rest of this week is dry and filled with miles.
</p>
<p>
We all know that marketing is lies. Anytime I return to watching cable tv, like a football game,
I am immediately reminded of this fact.
Marketing is loud and in your face -- thankfully there is a mute button.
Is this what we have become?
Well, it seems the answer is yes, at least in America --
where we no longer invent or make things any more -- we just market and talk, i.e. lie.
Sad.
</p>
<p>
A simple example is a so-called sports drink.
Look at the ingredients in Gatorade for example:
<ul>
<li>water -- that's good</li>
<li>sugar -- not good</li>
<li>high fructose corn syrup -- wtf? I think they removed this one</li>
<li>dextrose -- sugar by another name?</li>
<li>brominated vegetable oil -- again, wtf?</li>
<li>various gum's -- chewy?</li>
</ul>
... puddle water is better for you.
The lie in the marketing is that this drink helps your energy, hydration, and recovery.
Hello, it's sugar water with other crap in it.
Which is ok if you have the metabolism of a hummingbird.
If you want sugar water then put some sugar in your water -- and even better give
that to a hummingbird.
</p>

I will stick with water, an occassional coconut water, green tea, and coffee -- but mostly water.
