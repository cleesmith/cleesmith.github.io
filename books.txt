The Power of Myth by Joseph Campbell

could have been called a brief history of religion
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Tao, Buddhism, Shinto, Native American, other native cultures

not too much about Greek mythology
more about creation and society(order) myths
society = male  nature = female

lots about suffering, pain, and how that's how life is
p. 50: 
  "...brutal precondition of all life, which lives by the killing and eating of lives.
  You don't kid yourself by eating only vegetables, either, for they, are alive."
p. 82:
  "...most hideous act...killing and eating another living thing."
  "Life lives on life, that's what it's all about."

p. 115:
  "...have a sacred place... This is a place where you can simply experience
  and bring forth what you are and what you might be."

follow your bliss : how if you're just trying to survive with a family
life has no purpose
  "Life is a lot of protoplasm with an urge to reproduce and continue in being"
