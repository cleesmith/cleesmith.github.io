  And here is part 2 of <b>striving to know your self</b> with more about <b>perception</b> and <b>interpretation</b>:

  <div class="collapse" id="knowThyselfPart2">
    <div class="well">
This was recorded on Wednesday, April 19, 2017 about 7:30pm EDT.
<br />
So I want to talk about perception and interpretation.
When I say perception, I mean human perception.
And one of my points here is that it's
limited to our five or six senses. Some
people don't believe in the sixth sense.
I do, but you know, if you talk to them
long enough you can probably convince them
there's a sixth sense. But anyway there's
the five: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching.
<br /><br />
But I believe our sixth sense it is a real thing.
There are two examples that everyone is familiar with:
intuition and being watched.
It's like you just kind of know something, and that has
nothing to do with learning, it's instinct, it's innate in some way.
I say feeling of being watched, but really it's a sense, same thing again I
think everybody's had that one where you feel
somebody staring at you or somebody's behind you.
I mean I've had crystal clear experiences of this while while hiking on Appalachian Trail.
I could since there were coyotes, could
tell they were watching and being 
super quiet, yet you can tell that they're lurking and up to something.
As well as black bears on several occasions.
One time there was a bear doing that
kind of back and forth thing they do, i.e. stalking.
So you do the thing where you make yourself bigger to scare them off.
But of course I was armed, so if he got too close then one of us or both were going to die.
I don't think black bears are like grizzly bears, where you have to shoot them 20 times
just to make him stop. He or she always ran away.
<br /><br />
After the six senses, which I believe in personally, I would add two more senses to that. 
But I'm not going to go into any details, because to be quite honest it would be too controversial. 
And you know in a way the seventh and eighth senses are beyond symbolism. 
In other words, I couldn't express them in language even if I wanted.
I see languages as you know symbolic of whatever.
<br /><br />
Human perception is physical of course except maybe the six sense, and then maybe it is and we just don't know how it's working. 
But there's a distinct physical aspect to those five senses we all agree exists.
Those get translated from out there to inside us, where it becomes chemical reactions.
Chemistry obviously indicates that we're limited.
There's a limitation there in terms of what can be experienced and perceived, unless you go get some advanced training.
Maybe you go to Tibet, I've been to Tibet.
I got close to climbing a mountain but did not. 
I would say, if I was just talking to somebody it was due to the weather, but truth of it is that several of us got really sick. 
And we weren't even up that high yet, so that's not a good sign.
And they really wouldn't let us go on, well, I guess they would have let us keep going. 
But there's been so many deaths over there due to idiots climbing when they shouldn't. 
So that's my thoughts on human perception.
<br /><br />
Now to talk about interpretation, which is a kind of a complicated thing to talk about.
Interpretation is complicated by your age and experiences.
I'm not tying age together with experiences, but I mean there are some limits there. 
If you're 19 obviously different things are going on
in your body that would influence how
you interpret things. 
Also the stuff that you've experienced throughout your life alters your interpretation of things. 
In my case, there was a lot of trauma during childhood.
So that really took a long time to get past. 
I wouldn't say it's gone but it was dealt with and is somewhat controllable. 
I mean you know things come and go in life. 
Also under interpretation I have that it can change in an instant and that's true.
Your awareness changes based on your interpretation of things. 
Changes are often influenced by sleep and dreams that we don't remember and that's true. 
That's apparently part of what we're doing when we sleep, is we're reviewing stuff and making interpretations and drawing conclusions and all kinds of stuff.
And that to me kind of ties back to interpretations can change in an instant, because of something that you may have come to in while sleeping that you're not totally aware.
It's also difficult to control your interpretations, because there's always a little hint of uncertainty in there. 
Even though people shouldn't put things in little boxes like good bad, right wrong, none of that stuff, or good versus evil. 
Interpretation can be limited by the capabilities of our perceptions, I think I said that already.
I've had over the years several neighbors when I lived in apartments and townhouses that were blind and deaf. 
I derived a lot of insight from hanging around with them.
For a few years, there was a blind girl neighbor and we became close friends.
But she had a thing for being extremely vulgar.
I mean she had a thing for cussing, like she could probably make a sailor blush. 
She was something else, but I enjoyed being around her and we often talked about colors, light, and dark.
Her perspective was interesting.
Also, for a while I worked at a bowling alley. 
Not so much for the money, I think it's like 25 bucks an hour on the friday saturday sunday or something like that. 
I did it just to get time off from a situation i was currently experiencing and having to care for someone that was dying.
And sometimes that can be a bit much to deal with, so I worked there mainly for that reason.
There was a league of bowlers that couldn't speak or hear.
So I gave them a bit of special treatment by putting up their names and scores on the big screens using the computer.
They enjoyed it. But there was one girl that liked to argue with everyone.
We communicated using pen and paper.
And several times while bowling she would write "fuck you" in the notes we exchanged.
These are just simple examples of how your perception and interpretation can be influenced by your capabilities.
Interpretation can also be influenced by all of the input we are bombarded with every moment of every day.
Then we get caught up in that a little bit, where what we really should be doing is ignoring a lot of the 
coping methods that we use. 
And instead of always applying "know how" we should be doing "no how".
In other words, be open to receiving whatever without putting things into some predetermined box in your brain.
<br /><br />
So from the incense fog, I'll say peace and end it here.

<p>
  <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a> sure does make it easy to create 
  decent looking youtube thumbnail images, but the <i>free</i> background images are limited.&nbsp; 
  So I really want to paint my own version of a starry night with a person looking up.&nbsp; 
  Then use Canva just for the words, the text in the sky, because you can upload any image
  for the background.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  It does seem to be the case that youtube doesn't do subtitles for longer videos.&nbsp; 
  How long?&nbsp; I'm not sure, but this one is about 18 minutes and it got subtitles created.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">know thyself&nbsp;<small>Wednesday, April 18, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Yesterday I recorded a <b>twilight</b> video about getting to know your self.&nbsp; 
  My overly talkative and thoughtful time of day seems to be the dawn or sunset.&nbsp; 
  The video about being aware of our behavior in terms of four words or concepts: 
  <b>perception</b>, <b>interpretation</b>, <b>regurgitation</b>, and <b>deception</b>.&nbsp; 
  And how you may use those words as all of us <b>strive to know ourselves</b>.&nbsp; 
  Getting to truly know your self is one of the most important things you can do in life.&nbsp; 
  It doesn't matter if you do that using psychology, religion, witchcraft, meditation, or 
  spending time in nature.&nbsp; Just go observe animals, stare at dirt, or do absolutely 
  nothing at all and come to know your self.&nbsp; Spend some time with just you every day.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  After all, the only person you stand any chance of knowing is your self.&nbsp; Some say 
  they know their children.&nbsp; No you don't.&nbsp; Not even if you spent every moment 
  of every day with them.&nbsp; It's not like you can crack someone open and see 
  inside of them.&nbsp; Look at how often your children don't turn out like you 
  expected they would, and surprise you with their decisions.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">shadow monkey&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 15, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  While rereading a few older books, I've been thinking about our <b>shadow selves</b>.&nbsp; 
  Yep, we all have one.&nbsp; We're human.&nbsp; While I disagree with a lot of things the creator of 
  the following video spouts in other videos, this video is an excellent presentation:
  <br /><br />
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3I7TKW_QQbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br />
  Usually when researching our shadow self Freud, Jung, and psychology will inevitably appear.&nbsp; While I've 
  read a lot of psychology, I am not a fan.&nbsp; A simple video like this, poetry really, sums up 
  a whole lot of what we know about ourselves.&nbsp; Well, when we our honest with ourselves.&nbsp; With 
  that said, I decided to transcribe the video into printed words.&nbsp; My apologies if I screwed up the 
  grammar or misspelled some words.&nbsp; I used 
  <a href="http://ccsubs.com/" target="_blank">ccSubs</a> to extract the words as a <b>.sbv</b> file, then I 
  wrote a Ruby program that uses 
  <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/" target="_blank">Nokogiri</a> to remove the HTML and timestamps, 
  and ended up with this:
  <br />
  <blockquote>
  <p>
There's a monkey, in your mind.<br /> 
You know what I'm talking about.<br /> 
Don't be shy, don't feel ashamed, or embarrassed.<br />
There's no need to deny it.<br />
We've all got one.<br /> 
Telling us what to do, what we want, what we don't want.<br /> 
<br />
I call mine, <b>Trevor</b>.<br />
<br />
Sometimes he seems small and harmless and fun to be around.<br />
Sometimes he seems big and powerful.<br /> 
A dangerous idiot.<br /> 
Who doesn't know his own strength, and whose real anger knows virtually no limits.<br /> 
I must never forget that he's there.<br />
Waiting to take control.<br /> 
<br />
Trevor wants; everything!<br />
<br />
Wherever I look, there's something that Trevor wants.<br /> 
I never asked for this, to always want is to never be at peace.<br /> 
Even when all you want is peace.<br /> 
<br />
Thanks for the shit sandwich, Trevor!<br />
<br />
Trevor chooses what I find attractive.<br /> 
Trevor chooses what team I support.<br />
Trevor makes most of my mistakes.<br />
Trevor makes me say stupid things and do stupid things.<br /> 
He makes me look a fool.<br /> 
He can blind me to the obvious.<br /> 
He is the giver of false impressions.<br /> 
He is my instinct, my subconscious.<br /> 
When Trevor gets cut off in traffic, I feel a moment where I know he'd like to take the wheel and run somebody off the road.<br />
Sometimes the effort of controlling him makes my heart pound.<br /> 
You'd think that I'd hate him.<br />
But I can't.<br /> 
<br />
I have to live with him.<br />
He and I, are one.<br /> 
<br />
I must make peace with him, and though I inherited from him all that I would change, what would life be without emotion.<br /> 
<br />
Whatever our common ancestor was, they were not so different.<br /> 
They had something like wonder, kindness, curiosity, courage, empathy, joy, the bond of friendship, a sense of humor, a sense of fun.<br /> 
Far from shame that where we came from, what we still struggle with, I can normally only wonder at how far we have come against cosmic odds.<br /> 
You may say I'm romanticizing.<br /> 
You just see a violent ape, or look down on humanity as pointless dust, and you'd be right.<br />
Both times.<br /> 
But that's the truth for you.<br />
There's more than one way to look at it and still be factually accurate.<br /> 
I see a <b>piece of universe</b> <i>[people]</i> in a daze, wondering what the hell is going on.<br /> 
With the unfortunate naturally evolved tendency to believe what it's told, and all too often latching on to the first answer it is given.<br /> 
<br />
And I pity it.<br /> 
One cannot hate, what one pities.<br /> 
<br />
Humans get a bum rap.<br /> 
To me, the human is what overcomes instinct, not what falls to it.<br /> 
You need to understand that emotions, instincts are far more often wrong than right.<br /> 
To survive within us they only need to be right, when they need to be right.<br /> 
How many times have you jumped at a harmless sound? 
Compared to the number of times that that instinct has saved your life.<br /> 
It must be thousands to one against.<br /> 
Instincts are frighteningly often wrong.<br /> 
But they're always there, pulling your strings shaping you.<br /> 
The fears, lusts, rage, bigotry, hatred, racism, greed, selfishness, judgmentalism.<br />
Trevor is very religious.<br /> 
Trevor needs constant reassurance, that's why Trevor's religious.<br />
<br />
It can't be healthy to deny the obvious.<br />
<br />
There's a short-tempered, idiotic, small-minded, judgemental, egocentric, easily tempted, paranoid, bigoted, mind monkey in your head.<br /> 
And it's scared.<br /> 
And it's confused.<br /> 
And it's ashamed of its body.<br /> 
And it's ashamed of its nature.<br />
And it doesn't want to be the one thing it must be.<br />
Not realizing that it's so much more than just an ape.<br /> 
Most people can't see.<br />
Most simply don't know enough of the truth.<br /> 
The facts: that they are energy made solid, consciousness and form, from a harmony of natural forces.<br />
We might possess the only eloquent eyes that will ever exist.<br />
We might be the universe's poetry.<br /> 
It's only chance to know itself.<br /> 
Ever!<br />
War!<br />
War has got monkey written all over it.<br /> 
Why do you bow to kings, and men with more expensive ties, and bigger cars.<br /> 
You think because you don't piss in the street that you're in control of your instincts.<br /> 
Wrong!<br />
We think it's our idea, that we decide what we will do, how we will react.<br /> 
But it's the feelings that Trevor gives us.<br /> 
The emotions, the envy, the anger, frustration.<br /> so many fears.<br /> 
This is how it gets us to do its bidding.<br /> 
It's the humans caged by the monkey this time.<br />
Yes, we kill, slaughter, murder, torture, exploit, steal.<br />
But don't you see.<br /> 
That's Trevor.<br />
That's what Trevor does.<br />
That's what Trevor does to us.<br /> 
That's what we're up against, the inner ape is our only enemy.<br /> 
Why do you think people will risk their marriages, their children, their family, everything they love, even their lives, for a piece of ass.<br /> 
"Well, what else is there?"<br />
What else is there, asks the man at the back.<br /> 
And, that's my point.<br /> 
<br />
That's, Trevor, talking.<br />
<br />
Fight your mind monkey!<br />
Take control.<br /> 
Reason against reflex.<br /> 
Instincts lose much of their power over you when you understand them.<br /> 
The only way to be at peace is to get to know your inner monkey.<br /> 
Train it!<br />
Train it, just like you train a real monkey.<br /> 
<br />
Most of all, show them love and beauty.<br /> 
But remember, it can only look where you look.<br /> 
They can only see, what you see.<br /> 
You must show them.<br /> 
You must look for the beauty.<br />

<p>
  YouTube's motto should be:
  <blockquote>getting something for nothing</blockquote>
  which applies to almost 100% of the creators.&nbsp; I guess the 
  counter argument would be that it's just all about entertainment.&nbsp; 
  In other words, it's just the same old stuff as 
  theatre, town meetings, witch burnings,
  radio, broadcast TV, cable TV, and now streaming video.&nbsp; The content 
  is still nothing but misdirection and <i>hocus pocus</i>.&nbsp; Yep, 
  it can be fun as long as you remember to suspend your disbelief.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">falling&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 14, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Someone, maybe Einstein, once said that gravity is nothing more than a manifestation 
  due to everything falling towards something bigger.&nbsp; The whole space-time 
  curvature idea.&nbsp; It's a bit like this: put a bowling ball on a mattress, then roll another 
  ball towards it, that ball will <b>fall</b> into the bowling ball.&nbsp; It's not being 
  <b>pulled</b> by some force emanating from the bowling ball, rather it falls into it 
  due to a curvature in the mattress.&nbsp; But most of us see gravity as something that 
  <b>pulls</b> things in and not as falling towards something.&nbsp; That's fine, but 
  then there are <b>magnets</b>.&nbsp; Ever play with those?&nbsp; Sure seems like 
  there's some <b>pulling</b> going on with those.&nbsp; Perception?&nbsp; Being human is so limiting.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">giving&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 13, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Often people say that we are all selfish most of the time.&nbsp; That's probably true.&nbsp; 
  How can we not be?&nbsp; We are human.&nbsp; However, for me, <b>giving to others</b> started back 
  in the early 2000's after working a lucrative programming gig.&nbsp; It was just plain luck that 
  I got the gig instead of someone else.&nbsp; So that unexpected wealth plus a promise to a 
  friend got me started giving to others.&nbsp; By <b>others</b> I mean random <b>others</b>.&nbsp; 
  I was also influenced by the books and movies: <i>Pay It Forward</i> and <i>Nobody's Fool</i>, 
  even though each book and movie are very different.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  So for a while it was a selfish act.&nbsp; It did make me feel good to give.&nbsp; 
  But after doing this for many years now, I don't really feel that way any more.&nbsp; I don't 
  feel anything.&nbsp; It's nice when the person says, <i>thank you</i>, but I still don't 
  feel much of anything.&nbsp; Just to have something to say in email replies, I often spout 
  some new age bullshit about <b>abundance</b> or <b>attraction</b>.&nbsp;  That's total bullshit!&nbsp; 
  It seems the only thing humans can manifest is actual shit, you know poop.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  At this point, the act of giving and the recepients have all become some vague distant 
  random nothingness.&nbsp; Sometimes they don't even say <i>thank you</i>.&nbsp; 
  I just feel an empty, detached feeling of nothing.&nbsp; 
  So why continue?&nbsp; I suppose it's just something to do during retirement.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">journals&nbsp;<small>Wednesday, April 12, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  The following instagram photo shows some of the journals I've filled since becoming a hillbilly.&nbsp; The cardboard box 
  contains 12 older journals of 600+ pages each from about 1972 until 1985.&nbsp; I recently retrieved them from storage.&nbsp; 
  I could not fit the older more elaborate journals, aka scrapbook-like book of shadows, into the photo.&nbsp; 
  Several times I tried to capture this in a video for youtube, but I'm never satisfied with the end result.&nbsp; 
  Also, writing or reading or thinking a lot does not make one smart nor profound.&nbsp; That's obvious given 
  all of the blogs, opinions, e-books, and videos on the internet.&nbsp; I guess in a nutshell I've always been 
  given to searching and seeking.&nbsp; For what, I'm not sure.&nbsp; Just being human.&nbsp;

<p>
  Today marks yet another of life's milestones.&nbsp; My official retirement.&nbsp; Well, at least 
  from the government's point of view, as shown by receiving my first social security check.&nbsp; 
  Can one really celebrate this moment?&nbsp; On the one hand, yes, I get back the money I paid 
  into it, but on the other hand I am now <b>officially old</b>.&nbsp; I guess a better question 
  is do I feel old?&nbsp; Somedays, yes, and somedays, no.&nbsp; Again, <b>change</b> is about

<h2 class="section-heading">walking&nbsp;<small>Tuesday, April 11, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  In the year 2015 I walked over 3,500 miles.&nbsp; 
  Last year in 2016 I walked over 2,900 miles.&nbsp; That's more than the Appalachian Trail.&nbsp; 
  About 8 miles every day.&nbsp; At my age of 62, that's too much.&nbsp; So in 2017 I'm 
  going to decrease that to about 4 miles per day.&nbsp; About 10,000 steps, an hour 
  and a half or so of continuous walking.&nbsp; Yes, I walk slow.&nbsp;  Yes, I will have to eat less.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  This will free up some time so I can read, write, and do little chores around the house.
  <br />
  Or just sit on the porch, <b>do nothing</b>, and watch life go by.

<h2 class="section-heading">mow, salsa, mushrooms&nbsp;<small>Monday, April 10, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today I caved in and mowed the yard like all of my neighbors.&nbsp; It is April, 
  and I hate mowing as it's just a useless chore.&nbsp; For everyone in these parts, 
  mowing seems to be a hobby they love, so much so, that some of them do it as a side 
  job.&nbsp; It was in the 80's, so it was hot, and a good day to have some salsa 
  and mushrooms.&nbsp; Since I avoid sugar, flour, starch, which are all really 
  sugar, I replace the tortilla chips with mushrooms.&nbsp; Mushrooms are sometimes 
  referred to as <i>the eaters of the dead</i>.&nbsp; So it's a kind of life and 
  death combo in food form.&nbsp; But it really just tastes good and is refreshing 
  and hydrating on a hot day after mowing the yard.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">lazy day&nbsp;<small>Sunday, April 9, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Growing up christian means doing absolutely nothing on Sunday's.&nbsp; Maybe some family time.&nbsp; 
  For me it is no longer a religious thing.&nbsp; It's just socially acceptable, in america 
  anyways, to be lazy on this day.&nbsp; It's silly but nice.&nbsp; In the past few years, I 
  spend most Sunday's walking and reading which are two of my favorite things.&nbsp; 
  Unfortunately, I can remember a time when I worked every day of every week.&nbsp; Very exhausting.&nbsp; 
  However, I can remember a few times when I was unemployed and homeless--no food, no money.&nbsp; 
  So I've learned to go with the flow, and to live life a bit like air or water.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">a rant filled with info&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  It's not often that when someone goes on a <b>rant</b> that it contains any useful information.&nbsp; 
  Me included.&nbsp; Most often it's just someone speaking so passionately that 
  they are almost in tears, and, well, it's unpleasant to see someone weep while gnashing their teeth.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  But in this rant (in 2015?) by Michelle Belanger she offers a bit of history and background information:
  <br /><br />
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CucbeFZ3FlQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  <br />
  Like a lot of us, over time, she's a bit conflicted.&nbsp; She's been a goth, wiccan, witch, vampire, psychic, 
  TV personality, non-fiction writer, and fiction writer.&nbsp; Again, like a lot of us, we tend to be all over the 
  place as we learn and grow older.&nbsp; Not to mention the obvious that sometimes one has to do whatever 
  to earn some money and survive.&nbsp; Oh well, variety is the spice of life, right?

<h2 class="section-heading">strange blog indeed&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  As blogs go, this one is different.&nbsp; Most blogs are organized by year and month and in chronological 
  order.&nbsp; They have fancy graphics and colors to sparkle and grab your attention.&nbsp; 
  Not mine.&nbsp; I chose to divide the writing into different aspects of existence as I see it, and to focus 
  on the words alone.&nbsp; 
  This matches with how I write in my journals, which I've done everyday for many years now.&nbsp; It is an 
  obsession.&nbsp; I don't fool myself into believing that there's anything profound in my writing or even 
  interesting to someone else.&nbsp; Yet, I continue to do it.&nbsp; If anyone is actually reading this 
  blog they probably find it annoying to have to click on the nav bar links just to read the latest posts.&nbsp; 
  That's not a smart way to build and audience.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp; <br />
  Someday I will make a youtube that shows the pile of journals I recently retrieved from storage.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Also, I am considering adding a new link to the nav bar called <b>memoirs</b>.&nbsp; There I would just 
  <i>dump</i> stuff about me.&nbsp; I already have a lot of it handwritten in notebooks, and some of that 
  typed into text files that are in a private repo on github.&nbsp; But it might be interesting to try to 
  make them public, with more of a focus on turning the writings into a book.&nbsp; 
  Just a thought of an old person nearing the end of life, and memoirs are probably a common thought.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">feeling vs appearance&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  How do you feel right now, this very moment?&nbsp; For me, if I ignore the constant pain in my knee, middle 
  back(spine), and stomach I feel perfect.&nbsp; What if you look in a full length mirror?&nbsp; Now, how 
  do you feel?&nbsp; Yep, you're not as perfect as maybe you once were.&nbsp; The same goes for hopping on a 
  scale to check your weight, or feeling those bulges of fat you have here and there.&nbsp; But is appearance 
  anywhere near as important as how you actually feel?&nbsp; I guess it really boils down to desire.&nbsp; So 
  can you let go of your desires long enough to really feel?&nbsp; Try thinking and doing nothing for 
  some part of everyday.&nbsp; That can be difficult to do if you have family responsibilities, I know.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">hide contact form email to avoid spam&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="_blank">Formspree</a> is free for 1000 submissions per email each month.&nbsp; 
  Their service has been around for a while, so I'm giving it a try, so far so good.&nbsp; I doubt I will ever get anywhere 
  near 1000 emails per month, thankfully.&nbsp; However, if one just follows the instructions on their website you 
  will be exposing your email to spammers and bots that harvest emails.&nbsp; So a better approach is to hide 
  your email by encoding it as base64 and then using javascript to decode it for the contact's form action.&nbsp; 
  Sure, any human could just use some javascript to decode, but spammers rely on automation--otherwise that's not
  spamming.&nbsp; Also, I do get some spam anyways as my email is listed on several social media sites.&nbsp; 
  What's next?&nbsp; Maybe give <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a> a try for comments, 
  as most people don't really like sending emails even through a contact form.&nbsp; Then again, as I am not selling me 
  or anything, building an audience is not really important to me.&nbsp; Maybe not, as using Disqus probably means 
  that ad's appear, which is something I find annoying.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">mandela effect&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 7, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Just watched the video 
  <a href="https://youtu.be/QgwQezM3MxI" target="_blank">Explaining the Mandela Effect (Prepare to have your brain scrambled!)</a> 
  by The Paranormal Scholar.&nbsp; As always her presentation is cool and interesting, but it did not scramble my brain.&nbsp; 
  Often it seems the obvious gets overlooked in things like this, which is the fact that people are involved.&nbsp; 
  In other words, the common bit is the human condition.&nbsp; So is it really all that surprising that similar 
  things happen to different people, afterall we are not that different from each other.&nbsp; My <b>I</b> and your 
  <b>I</b> are almost exactly the same.&nbsp; The skeptic flag is also raised by the appearance of any 
  reference to psychology--Carl Jung.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; The answer lies in quantum theory, multiverses, an 
  astronaut's theory, and psychology all mashed up together, really?&nbsp; Instead of the obvious facts that human 
  memories are imperfect and humans are almost exact clones of each other.&nbsp; 
  Brain scrambling, no, thought provoking, yes.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Also, their website really sucks because WordPress sucks, pop ups that force me to click suck!&nbsp; 
  The description for this video contains a much better motto for their channel:
  <i>Discussion is the lifeblood of understanding</i>, which is much better than: 
  <i>The more you know, the more there is to fear</i>.&nbsp; 
  I know, way too much complaining.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">following&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 7, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  There's something about the word <b>following</b> that doesn't sit well with me.&nbsp; 
  Yet, I started following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheParanormalScholar" target="_blank">The Paranormal Scholar</a> 
  on YouTube.&nbsp; Mostly I watch their history documentaries and not the paranormal garbage.&nbsp; 
  I don't like their motto: <i>The more you know, the more there is to fear</i>.&nbsp; I get they are 
  just trying to increase subscribers/views by being dramatic.&nbsp; But that doesn't make any sense, as 
  who in their right mind would want more fear.&nbsp; Perhaps, they're targeting those into horror movies.&nbsp; 
  However, their history videos are well researched and lack the overly dramatic stuff.&nbsp; Of course, 
  this dichotomy between history and paranormal makes me doubt their content on the whole, but it's 
  just entertainment afterall.&nbsp; Their own conflict is apparent in the channel title: paranormal and scholar.&nbsp; 
  For learning about history I tend to view things like 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK_NHLbnG-k9a3-TQCeW1G3aTZLhxgvI8" target="_blank">The Other Side of History</a>, 
  of course this is just as limited by the known as anything else--i.e. just because it has a college professor that 
  is lecturing does not make it's content totally accurate.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  The reason I don't like the word <i>paranormal</i> is that I feel that anything we can experience 
  is actually <b>normal</b>.&nbsp; Isn't seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and feeling all normal things for
  people to do?&nbsp; Assuming one can do those things.&nbsp; The word <i>paranormal</i> just has too 
  many negative connotations, whether it deserves them or not.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">trying to not think&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today is one of those days where I <b>do not want to think about anything</b>.&nbsp; 
  Have you ever tried to do that?&nbsp; 
  It is not easy to do.&nbsp; Many years ago when I ran six or miles everyday, it was much easier to 
  reach a point where my mind would just get quiet.&nbsp; I don't know if that was because of all of 
  those chemicals released when a body is under stress.&nbsp; Meditation just never worked for me.&nbsp; 
  So now I'm stuck with just going for long walks, which only kind of quiets my mind but mostly I seem to 
  think about everything: past, present, and future.&nbsp; Mind chatter is just a natural thing, like digesting food.&nbsp; 
  Sometimes it works to completely exhaust myself by not sleeping enough, and eventually it seems to catch 
  up with me and I completely pass out.&nbsp; It is a healthy thing if you can stop thinking even for brief moments.&nbsp; 
  A friend had the idea that there should exist places, like beautiful parks or gardens, where one 
  can just go and <i>somehow</i> while you are in there you can't think about anything.&nbsp; It's a great 
  idea, but how to achieve that <i>somehow</i> is the mystery.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">do it again&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  <i>Do it again</i> is something often said by children and implied by animals/pets.&nbsp; 
  And if you think about it, in a way, that simple phrase holds the meaning to why everything exists.&nbsp; 
  Could it be that what we call life and death is little more than the desire to <b>do it again</b>?&nbsp; 
  As in all over again, through fresh new eyes, so to speak.&nbsp; 
  To marvel at and play amongst everything that exists around us.&nbsp; To experience everything.&nbsp; 
  Yes, even pain and suffering, although I doubt anything that has feelings would ever say <i>do it again</i>.&nbsp; 
  But pain, suffering, and other unpleasant stuff are a part of existence and just another experience.&nbsp; 
  Don't get me wrong, as I am in no way belittling pain and suffering because I have struggled with both 
  of these for many years now.&nbsp; Daily I struggle to cope with physical chronic knee, back, and stomach pain.&nbsp; 
  Given my past, I also struggle with mental pain.&nbsp; Both together equal quite a bit of suffering.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">over population&nbsp;<small>Tuesday, April 4, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I have heard the <b>everyone fits in Texas myth</b> repeated a lot 
  in blogs, NPR, and videos.&nbsp; In case you don't know, the Texas myth is that Earth is not 
  really over populated because everyone could fit in an area the size of the state of Texas.&nbsp; 
  Assuming we could tolerate being that close to each other, personally, I think we are too close 
  to each other as it is now.&nbsp; Here's an old school internet style web page that goes into further 
  <a href="http://ingles.homeunix.net/rants/density.html" target="_blank">details</a>.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  For those of us who love nature, it is frustrating to watch as planet Earth 
  is raped, pillaged, and plundered.&nbsp; Then again, the Earth was here before humans and 
  will be here long after we are gone.&nbsp; It survived the dinosaurs consuming everything 
  in sight, and will survive whatever we do as well.&nbsp; Yet, it's still frustrating and 
  sad to just standby and only watch it all go down the crapper.&nbsp; <b>Change</b> is the only 
  reliable thing, whether or not we think it's for the better or worse.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">rant about blogs&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 1, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Why do people have text in their blogs that looks like it does in printed books?&nbsp;
  By that I mean why is the right hand margin all even and lined up ... it looks weird.&nbsp;
  Does anyone space out words to even up the right hand margin when they write by hand.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
  It just looks weird and unnatural.&nbsp; Yes, I get why they do it in books, to save on 
  the cost of paper.&nbsp; But it still looks weird and hyphenated words are annoying to read.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">reading and writing &nbsp;<small>Thursday, March 30, 2017</small></h2>

  I downloaded the PDF for this book:

    Thirty Years Among the Dead
  </a> 
  &nbsp;<small>by Dr. Carl A. Wickland, M.D.</small>&nbsp;
  <br />
  The PDF is free if you google the title, not sure how amazon can get away charging $2 for it.&nbsp; 
  Also, I have spent some time rearranging and writing for this blog, of which I'm probably the only reader.&nbsp; 
  I did link to here from my youtube about page as well as instagram.&nbsp; And I did submit the URL 
  to google's search engine.&nbsp; Maybe it's just me but I find that when I read a lot I don't often 
  have much to write, other than boring daily life stuff -- which I already hand write in a journal.&nbsp; 
  This should not surprise me, after all, when is the last time I read anything that was 
  <i>earth shattering</i> or even all that profound about the human condition.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Been thinking about my feelings after visiting the 
  <a href="https://cleesmith.github.io/spirit.html" target="_blank">hospital</a> last night.&nbsp; Not 
  because I was ill or injured but it's something I do often.&nbsp; Hospitals are like revolving 
  doors between the land of living and the land of the dead.&nbsp; Maybe <i>realm</i> is a 
  better word than <i>land</i>.

<h2 class="section-heading">retrieved from storage &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 29, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Since I completed working on a programming gig I started last month, I went and retrieved some 
  items from storage.&nbsp;   I like having empty rooms and closets in my house, so I pay to store things I 
  want to keep, you know, in those secure and climate controlled storage places.&nbsp;   I retrieved two boxes 
  of old journals (some are what I use to call "book of shadows"), a bunch of old books (to be reread and
  reviewed), some old t-shirts, candles, and art supplies I had forgot I bought.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Often when I am grieving over the loss of someone I become nostalgic and gather around me some old things.&nbsp; 
  Also, I tend to write and read even more than usual, which is normally a lot.&nbsp;   So I have started to focus on my 
  blog again and thinking about what direction my YouTube videos should take in the future.&nbsp;   I am considering 
  a new Google account to allow for a <i>pen name</i> and be more anonymous.&nbsp;   As we all know, the world is 
  filled with <i>whacko's</i> and <i>wing nut's</i> which are best kept as far away as possible.&nbsp;

<p>
  Why are there so many websites where the <b>meat</b> of the page is totally surrounded by ad's,
  tiny videos, <i>follow us</i>, and other annoying garbage?  I guess the "word" is
  not as powerful as we've been told.&nbsp; 
  We actually came to their page to read the article, and not to be bombarded by ad's, pop-up's, or whatever.&nbsp; 
  It gets worse as you scroll down while reading -- <b>pop up's</b> occur or videos start playing or
  the page refreshes parts of itself and becomes unresponsive.&nbsp; 
  My usual reaction is to immediately close the page.&nbsp;  Yes, I will not follow, nor like, nor participate 
  in such annoying nonsense -- usually the content on such websites is totally useless.&nbsp; 
  There should be a web browser setting that can only load the <b>readable text</b> on a page and nothing else.&nbsp; 
  You know, like the old days of the internet.&nbsp; 
  Ok, I found <a href="http://www.textise.net/" target="_blank">Textise</a> which is slow but makes annoying

  The two biggest health problems are <b>chance</b> and <b>time</b>.&nbsp; 
  By <b>chance</b> I mean one may be predisposed to certain illnesses, it's just the
  luck (bad luck) of the draw.&nbsp; 
  By <b>time</b> I mean everything happens so slowly as to be almost imperceptable.&nbsp; 
  We suck at observing the small and slow changes that occur to our bodies.&nbsp; 
  We seem to only notice things just after they have happened -- like noticing you are 
  over 40 years old and suddenly you need reading glasses.&nbsp;  As a voracious reader 
  that was a bad day.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  It always seems to be a <b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.&nbsp;

<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
<span>Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.&nbsp; </span>
<span>After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.&nbsp; </span>
<span>You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>When it comes to calories, life is not fair.&nbsp; </span>
<span>
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting so much and focus on the quality of what you eat and eat less of it.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<p>
<span>Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.&nbsp; </span>
<br />
<span>There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.&nbsp; </span>
<span>For example <b>-- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts --</b> these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have a beer belly too.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<p>
<span>Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.&nbsp; </span>
<span>In fact, we do not need to eat any carbohydrates, but fruit is nice sometimes.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>
  Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.<br />
  <small>Hippocrates</small><br />
  <small>
    That's a nice quote, but don't forget that Hippocrates was a male in ancient Greece.<br />
    Which means he thought women were lesser humans, as in suffering from <b>hysteria</b> and 
    a <b>wandering uterus</b>.<br />
    And so, take his advice with a lot of salt.
