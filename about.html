<h2 class="section-heading">nowadays</h2>
<p>
  Once upon a time my life was utterly consumed with computers and programming them.&nbsp;  And 
  some family time.&nbsp;   And making money.&nbsp;   It was 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, the sort 
  of thing that wears you out and fills you with regret in retrospect.&nbsp;   Now that I am old 
  enough and can afford to not work anymore, I am beginning to get familiar with doing nothing.&nbsp;   
  By nothing I mean absolutely nothing.&nbsp;   It has taken over a year to get comfortable doing 
  nothing.&nbsp;   It is hard to just walk away from working and easy money.&nbsp;   I am still drawn to 
  computers and programming.&nbsp;   But ever so slowly I am beginning to focus all of my time on 
  my past, history, death, and spirituality.&nbsp;   
</p>
<p>
  When I was young I was exposed to the Catholic and Baptist churches.&nbsp;   As well as many 
  Native American Cherokee beliefs, which are similar to paganism, witchcraft, and necromancy.&nbsp;   
  Of course, that's just my opinion.&nbsp;   I do not enjoy churches: the perfume, dressing up, and
  hypocrisy are all too much.&nbsp;   A lot of churches changed what used to be "fire and brimstone" 
  style services to something called "praise and prayer" which involve dominant church 
  members talking way too much.&nbsp;   I missed getting "damned and yelled at" then singing songs, 
  so I stopped going.&nbsp;   Although, there are some aspects of Christianity that I do 
  respect: "<i>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</i>" and other useful ideas.&nbsp;  
</p>
<p>
  However, for most of my life I think of myself as someone on a <strong>search for spirituality</strong>.&nbsp;   
  I have tried being christian, being pagan, being a witch, being a necromancer, being whatever--you name it.&nbsp;   
  To me, enlightenment isn't possible.&nbsp;   Knowing the meaning of life isn't possible.&nbsp;   I have come 
  to the conclusion that this thing we call life is just a collection of separate organisms that 
  are somehow stuck together to form a human (or animal or plant or whatever).&nbsp;   That collection of 
  separate organisms seems to want to stay alive and procreate -- big time, they cling to life.&nbsp;   As a human 
  we in control of less than 1 percent of the organisms (cells) that make up our body.&nbsp;   When 
  we are asleep we are in control of nothing, some people even pee and poop in their sleep.&nbsp;   
  Some of us are plagued by sleepwalking.&nbsp;   Occasionally, I even chain myself 
  while in bed to avoid doing something horrible, like taking a gun and shooting someone or 
  driving the car without being awake.&nbsp;   Actually, the <b>chain</b> is a synthetic strap that loops 
  through an anchor bolt in the floor, and I am handcuffed to that -- sounds kinky, huh?&nbsp; 
  Nope, it's not <i>fifty shades</i> of anything.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  I do believe (as in <i>a belief</i> not <i>a certainty</i>) there is more to life than just a body.&nbsp;   
  Call it soul, spirit, or whatever.&nbsp;   All bodies decay back into star dust.&nbsp;   It sounds better to say "star dust" 
  than mud or dust or a pile of chemicals (rocks).&nbsp;   
</p>
<blockquote>
  I have felt or sensed <b>it</b>.&nbsp; Whatever <b>it</b> is, I believe it is.&nbsp;   
</blockquote>
<p>
  I believe we may never know the answers to all of our questions.&nbsp;   Maybe 
  there are <b>no answers</b> or maybe the answers are right in front of our noses and we just 
  can't understand.&nbsp; Or perhaps <b>knowing</b> is way overrated, and it's just a 
  human nature sort of thing to always be in <i>detective mode</i> -- it's innate to try and 
  figure stuff out.&nbsp; We are curious in more ways than one.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">Tools of the trade</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>C/C++ -- <small>super speed manna</small></li>
  <li>Ruby -- <small>manna from heaven</small></li>
  <li>Elixir/Erlang -- <small>cool but different</small></li>
  <li>Go -- <small>gofmt, fast static compiles, and concurrent manna</small></li>
  <li>Python -- <small>hobbyist manna with tabs -- 2 versus 3, what a mess -- enough said</small></li>
  <li>Java -- <small>the total opposite of manna</small></li>
  <li>text editors -- <small>all of them, it does not matter, just learn to type fast</small></li>
  <li>operating systems -- <small>all of them, it does not matter, just RTFM -- ok, *nix only</small></li>
</ul>
Mostly I code in C/C++. A good thing. After all,
everything is written using it, including other languages.
Although, some languages are eventually written in themselves,
but they all started in C.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Visibility</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately most of my work is private.
I do have some code, experiments, and projects on <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith?tab=repositories" target="_blank">github</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Language Experience</h2>
<p>
mainframe:<br>
Pascal (in college with punched cards), Fortran, RPG, COBOL, PL/I, Natural/AdaBas,
Assembler, C, REXX, way too much JCL -- wait, is that a language? no, it's more like bash scripts
<br><br>
mini's and PC's:<br>
Turbo Pascal, Forth (self-altering code is cool), Basic, ASM, PowerBuilder,
ASP then .NET, Smalltalk,
Lisp, Ada, Prolog, Clojure, Javascript, Coffeescript, Tcl, PHP, Erlang, Rust, Haskell, GoLang
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Hardware Experience</h2>
<p>
mainframe:<br>
every IBM 360, 370, etc. -- basically everything IBM has made starting with the 360 and beyond
<br>
<blockquote>
<b>can you imagine:</b>
<br>
- disk drives and tape silos that are across the room from the cpu
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- now that's speed and storage -- makes PC's seem mundane and useless
<br>
- all in a special built data center with:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- cables the size of your arm hidden under the floor
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- a temperature that's so cold you could hang meat on hooks
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- halon gas dispensers to stop fires (WTF? who needs an ozone layer)
</blockquote>
<span class="caption text-muted">
Now that is serious computing with unlimited power, resources, and a budget for such.
</span>
<span class="caption text-muted">
Entering that room, well, it felt a bit like meeting the source
in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKpFFD7aX3c" target="_blank">Matrix</a> (bullshit action movie).
</span>
</p>
<p>
mini's:<br>
DEC's PDP-11, Sun, Honeywell, Sperry Rand
</p>
<p>
PC's:<br>
Altair, Super ELF, Timex Sinclair, Commodore's stuff, IBM,
every Apple ever made, and a room full of self-built computers including
large servers, raspberry pi's, banana pi's, arduino's -- you name it
<blockquote>
  Most of the above PC's still work properly, and my house is sort of a museum.
