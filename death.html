<h2 class="section-heading">respectful</h2>
<p>
  <blockquote>
    After rereading this page, it felt as though I was being disrespectful or trivializing death.<br />
    To be clear, I have the utmost respect for the dead and the process of dying.<br />
    These are just death related events that have occurred in my life.

<h2 class="section-heading">tinker bell &nbsp;<small>Monday, April 10, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Do you believe in fairies?&nbsp; What I mean by that is do you remember the time when you stopped 
  playing like a child.&nbsp; I was able to find a comment I made in an old journal.&nbsp; It didn't 
  have an exact date and time, but it was more like I realized that I no longer played with my G.I. Joe 
  doll.&nbsp; Wait, I was a boy so Joe was an <i>action figure</i> and not a <i>doll</i>, which is bullshit 
  as Joe was as much a doll as Ken.<br /> 
  Why is this on the Death page?<br />
  Because <b>death is just another big change</b> in your life.&nbsp; 
  The same as the rite of passage between being a child and becoming 
  an adult.&nbsp; Once it hits you, there's really no going back.&nbsp; I feel, the same is 
  true for the death of our bodies.&nbsp; So, just as you mostly didn't fear becoming an adult, 
  you shouldn't fear dying all that much.&nbsp; After all <b>nobody has a choice</b>.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">a dear friend passes &nbsp;<small>Monday, March 27, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Last week a dear friend past away.&nbsp;  I miss her.&nbsp;  I will miss her crazy emails and text messages.&nbsp; 
  She was an internet friend, if that counts as friendship -- to me it's a bit like the 
  old days where people expressed unrequited love by writing letters and sending them through the mail.&nbsp; 
  We only met in person twice for coffee.&nbsp;  Both times were a bit awkward, as is usually the 
  case for me.&nbsp;  There's something about sitting in front of someone's animated face that 
  can be off-putting.&nbsp;  I assisted with her funeral arrangements, as I had 
  promised her I would do, because her big family disowned her many years ago.&nbsp; 
  Forgiveness can be a tough nut.&nbsp;  She dealt with cancer for many years, not really 
  clinging to life but going with the flow.&nbsp; 
</p>
<blockquote>Liz, <b>I love you</b> and I'm sure it's a far better place where you are now.</blockquote>
