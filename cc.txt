do you have a wiki name that how did you come by it

where are you located what brought you to that area or were you born there 

do you wear a special a note or jewelry for spell work 

what's your favorite
space or place I'm honestly not sure I'm
assuming it's obviously meaning you know
in regards like which eNOS not just like
whatever you know I'm sorry if you can
hear the TV my father likes it really
loud and it's right outside this room
and he will not turn it down um I
usually work in my room because I tried
working outside before and like in my
backyard and I've done that on two
occasions and one was on Fallon and
these kids not like little bitty kids
probably like 10 to 12 we're like went
up to my fins and start staring in and
yelling things at me even after I feel
like we asked him to leave me be and
another time my mother kept coming out
and interrupting me and she let the
animal out there and the dog and the cat
kept like running at my feet and almost
tripped me once and I was and I was
crashed into a little
and that i had my candles on I was like
yeah this is not working so I'm since
they don't my parents and really nobody
except people on YouTube and a couple
people i pimped out with no I'm a witch
it's kind of difficult to let you
explain what exactly are you doing worry
about these candles what's with this
what's with that what are you doing you
know when people can see you what's your
favorite stone or crystal for magical
working for magical workings I've got a
couple of samples here I like the
traditional clear quartz this is just a
point you know like a wand I like that
because you can kind of program it to do
whatever you want and it's my cheer with
quit moving I like that for that reason
but i also like Salafist for meditation
is just a small little kind of chunk yes
I like it for meditation in to help with
my migraines although lately I've also
oh well another favorite is calcite I'm
just really drawn to it this is honey
calcite kind of a big piece not a huge
but it's decent sized and lately I've
been very drawn to sell night which is
the heart that I have some of my heart
and then also this is sectarian I think
it's kind of knows it it's really pretty
and kind of see you around it's got a
price tag on it so I don't want another
really see that but it's really pretty
it's kind of a funny shape when I was up
a store the other day I've been wanting
a piece of this for a while and I was at
the store the other day and saw this one
and I saw this one first and like really
bad several bit with this shape I really
connected to this one and then I saw
they had like a crystal ball a small one
you know not huge but not tiny and I
really connected with that one but I
decided to get this one because I
connected with it first so and it didn't
hurt that it was a few dollars cheaper
not that bad side you know my main focus
but whatever how long have you been
practicing and how did you come to this
path bit of a complicated answer but as
a pagan pretty much my whole life and
just didn't really realize it until I
was about 9 years old when I was
introduced to paganism so I've been paid
in 17 years officially you know like
after I was introduced to turn was like
oh yeah that's what I believe because I
grew up christian but i guess i've been
practicing about 15 years but not
solidly when i was introduced to
paganism is when i was introduced to
witchcraft and I you know started
practicing pretty straight away but then
when I was about what 12 to 14 I thought
this like I need to be Christian again
because I'm going to go to hell feeling
cuz like no one really knew but my best
friend at the time it was the one who
introduced me her father was a high
priestess an Universal high priest the
high priest obviously not princess
that's the loan he was a high priest and
he had taught her some and she wouldn't
told me about it and I have a bit of a
video i do i have a video on this from
the youtube page a child 2016 but um
yeah and so she told me some about it
and I was just really connected with it
and so we started practicing together
but then she ended up moving away and I
just felt really alone and I felt like I
need to go back to Christianity I just
felt I don't know but really still I was
so pagan I just was feeling I don't know
I just felt lost by myself I think and I
wanted to connect with other people of
the same religion so I thought well I
need to go back to Christianity cuz I
didn't I didn't know any other pagans
and I don't know I don't really know
what I was thinking so I tried to earn
that for a couple years but I just never
really connected to
again and it just it felt wrong and I
just really tried to stick it out and
like it just it just wasn't me so I just
I went back to paganism about to being a
witch and it just ever since just it's
been right so I guess I went back when I
was maybe 13 and a half or 14 yeah do
you have a deity god or goddess and how
did you connect with them for a while I
would say that a nervous with my patron
and bass was my patroness and yes I used
patron assisted matron because a matron
means old woman and I don't I don't like
to think of like a goddess it's like an
older woman so I say patroness and so
but I felt I felt like it was really
more of me like wanting a God guys and
trying to like force the connection
there because I really liked those two
and after a while I kind of realized it
was more me trying to force that
connection and I mean I did connect to
them I felt like it was more you know me
trying to reach out to them and not so
much them coming to me and so I was like
okay thank you and you know I'm going to
let you go now because you're obviously
not coming to me it's me coming to you
or and so now I don't really have a god
goddess or a special beauty that I work
with I'm kind of starting to believe i
think that the gods and goddesses are
they're not it's not so much that I
don't I don't it's hard to put into
words but i don't think i don't
necessarily it's not that there's not
gods and goddesses but i think there's
it's more of like a divine energy source
or something store like that I'm not
really really fell out of my beliefs on
that right now because I'm kind of
transitioning from believing that
there's gods and goddesses and like can
it we view them in human archetypes to
viewing it more is like one big source
that humans just see as gods and
goddesses but they're not actually
gods and goddesses that humans just
break it down like that because it's
easier for us to understand it that way
if you know what I mean anyway that's
kind of rambling now what's your
favorite innocence or smudge this is
going to be kind of a unpopular opinion
but I don't really like instant um and
it's not just because I have asthma also
that is part of it but if I is because
if I burn really smoky ones on them for
too long they do bother my asthma but
it's more about you know you pick up the
stick and it's not burning and you smell
it oh it's a little good right but then
you lied it and it smells like smoke and
I did not like the smoke smell and you
can still smell the smell it's supposed
to smell like right but to me because my
nose and my senses in general are so
sensitive I just smell the smoke it's
like well if I wanted smoke I just like
light my house on fire you know I don't
like to smell smoke so I arrived start
smoking or something you know I don't
know not me no thank you but my favorite
smudge is Palo Santo I don't think it
doesn't smoke a lot at least not the one
I have and so I don't feel like I feel
like it doesn't you're not just smelling
smoke but I don't I don't use it a ton i
only when I feel on you two and it's
expensive too so have you ever had a
clear space of a negative entity I'm not
going to entity no but a negative energy
yes I think I've also told a little bit
about this but I have a family member
who is just very negative it's just like
it's not necessarily that she's always
liked trying to be negative but just her
persona just it's like she exudes a
negative energy it's just like how she
is I don't know she's unhappy if she's
just unhappy with herself with the world
with what but it's like you know those
people who are just like upbeat and
peppy and didn't fit and healthy all the
time
it's sort of like that but she's just
negative just because a zoo is the
energy and because I'm an impact it's
like I soaked it up and like she can
leave the house be gone you know and I
just it's like I can feel it I can feel
it in the house and I don't have a
choice but to live with her because of
my situation with the chronic illness
and not being able to have a job and
having someone has to be take care of me
and just all this just a big situation
that I can't control the end so I don't
have a choice but i don't really have
much much of a choice there but anyway
so yes I do have to clear the space
occasionally so what's your favorite
Richie show a movie I really like Harry
Potter and I really like that movie the
skeleton key I really like that one and
then these next 2 i'm not exactly sure
they're not like super wiki but they are
a little bit I like Buffy and the show
once upon a time i don't i don't know
some people might sort of consider those
which you some people might not I don't
know depends on your view I guess what
do you do to help raise energy before
spell work i cloned myself and put on
music I like music do you see yourself
helping others magically sometimes I
think I would really like to I think
it's amazing to like open up a shop and
sell like candles and soaps and bath
products and incense and herbs and you
know oils and all kind of stuff that I
make and then also bring in like other
products that may be other people have
made or that are just kind of like to
send a candle stuff it's sort of like I
don't want to say generic but like you
know that's just kind of like popular
the kind of a lot of people use but then
like my kind of rational side kicks in
to me like this never going to happen
you know like with your illness and the
fact that like it takes like a bunch of
energy just to like make a youtube video
like if you can't even like do that and
you can't even like hold down a job and
you're like at a pain level is like an 8
out of 10 on a good day yeah then ain't
never going to happen what is your
preferred form of divination sorry to be
such a downer probably just being honest
what is your preferred form of
divination I like pendulums although i
don't do divination a whole lot yeah i
don't know i just don't do definition of
a lot i don't feel it's really necessary
but i do like pendulums i'd like to be
done to tarot card but they're just
they're real hard to learn for me what
element do you work with most when I
read this question my automatic answer
was fire because I used candles but then
when I thought about it more I was like
holy maybe it's actually earth because I
used crystals and I use herbs that I
grow in my garden plus herbs that I by
so maybe it's actually earth or maybe
they're sort of fire and Earth are sort
of about equal I'm not sure so I really
enjoy working in my garden I don't have
a garden ghia around because during the
winter it does not really much you can
grow although it doesn't get super cold
here in Texas but still I mean it is
cold enough that you can't really grow
much but during the spring and summer
and stuff I do grow a garden and I've
got one starting now and I love growing
stuff it's it's a lot of fun and I love
being able to use it in my kitchen
witchery and in like my I make like oils
and stuff for my bath products and I
find fusing um you know and then I use
them and just kind of like regular like
regular diploid tree oh I know you do
that one if you throw a party which
other YouTube which is would you invite
kind of a weird question but um I guess
pretty much everyone except the drama
llamas
what are yer what she calls from a new
year new Year's already started because
this was started a few months back but I
think basically to try to deepen my
spirituality cuz last few months or so I
guess two or three months I've been on
kind of a slump I just haven't felt good
and I'm it felt like really doing
anything witchy and I don't cast spells
a lot because I believe they should be
kind of a last resort but I haven't
really been just connecting with my
spirituality or really doing a whole lot
and I also like to start getting to work
on my working book of shadows and
getting a bunch of information together
and working on that which is going to
slow process but I'd like to start
getting all the information together and
putting it in my works and book of
shadows and then maybe by the time
Dexter comes around I'll be able to work
on my final book shows so yeah that was
question 16 and I hope you all enjoyed
this video please comment rate and
subscribe and I will see you all later
blessing
