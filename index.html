  interesting ... <em>Operating-System-As-A-Virus</em>
</a>
</pre>

<pre>
feel like ranting so here goes:
why do some constantly <em>pat themselves on the back</em> ... it seems a total lack of confidence

it's puzzling how some people can give programming advice when they are so obviously not a programmer,
but only dabble at it, and yet regurgitate all of this stuff they have read and misunderstand

also, there's no proof of experience as their github account only has a single slow and unreliable python project

if you have never coded anything in ruby then shut up about programming or invest some
time in learning how to program
... obviously, you don't know wet if you're never touched water, jump in already

things that are NOT <b>new nor next gen</b> or even all that interesting:
<ul>
  <li>calling external api's ... this has been done in lots of apps for many years now
  <li>
    locking an app while streaming ... only 1 client can be served, which is not really a server, right?

  <li>
    code that's comprised of giant <b>for</b> loops, and
    tons of conditional statements (if's/else's) ... indicates zero OO skills

  <li>bookmarklet, <em>nuff</em> said
  <li>
    doing all of the above in one app is little more than a fascination with
    the <em>tried and abandoned</em> of the past ... in a futile effort to be <em>original</em>

</ul>
</pre>

<pre>
the beauty of Ruby and what few people understand ... simplified:
- <b>1.class</b> means <b>1</b> is an <b>object</b> whose <b>class</b> is Fixnum
- <b>Fixnum.instance_methods(false)</b> reveals this object to have these methods [:to_s, :+, :-, :==, etc], so
- <b>1.to_s</b> is really 1.send(:to_s) and <b>1 + 1</b> is really 1.send(:+, 1)
- yes, <b>send</b> is just passing a <b>message</b> to an <b>object</b>
- of course, I don't need to know about <em>sending messages to objects</em> just to do <b>1 + 1</b>
absolute beauty and why I say it's <b>manna from heaven</b>, ok, actually Japan
but it may be more beautiful to have a language like Smalltalk with only 6 keywords and no conditionals ... true OO

can't remember where I got these but every developer should be more:
<ul>
  <li>Smalltalk infected
  <li>Condition (if/else/case) averse
  <li>Message centric<br>
    - don't own the behavoir of an object<br>
    - null object pattern<br>
    - composition ... beware of always using inheritance, it's not for sharing behavoir<br>
    - independency injection for behavior

  <li>Abstraction seeking
</ul>

another hot day, but it's the weekend and that's <em>my time</em> ... what to do today ?
turn on wifi, sit out on my new porch, and do some reading/research or watch conference videos ?
watch the grass grow, do nothing ? ... nothing is really something
</pre>

<pre>
at last the screening of the porch is done, both cats/skeeters hate it, I love it
the usual home/person chores plus 8 hours of programming every day, need a vacation
while I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's, all sorts of projects but mostly camera oriented,
and they're great fun, it's become annoying to see/hear everyone repeat the <b>hype</b>
that it only costs $35
it's NOT true:
  <ol>
    <li>shipping and handling
    <li>it arrives and you unbox something that doesn't do anything
    <li>no power supply
    <li>no monitor
    <li>no keyboard
    <li>no mouse
  </ol>
  all of the above cost extra money, so you're far closer to $100+ than $35
  why does everyone continue to repeat <em>it only costs $35</em> ?
</pre>

the Avengers movie was <em>ok</em>, who doesn't like watching the black widow jump around
a bit more work left on the porch today
drove 30 miles yesterday to get a burger and banana shake at a <em>drive in</em>, you know,
one of those places where you sit in your car and eat ... they still have those around here
the doctor would probably not like the idea of eating <em>drive in</em> food,
but life's short so enjoy it sometimes
oh yeah, the banana shake actually had a real ripened banana in it ... it was oh so good
<a href="https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby" target="_blank">google-drive-ruby</a>
looks interesting ...
wonder how it compares to python's
<a href="https://github.com/burnash/gspread" target="_blank">gspread</a> in terms of reliability
</pre>

<pre>
      research what's involved with <b>updating</b> documents in elasticsearch and how
      such an action may affect a large amount of data
      bought some expensive plexiglass for the entrance to the porch to keep out the rain
      the neighbor's cat, aka my pets, as I feed/play with them, do not like the screened in porch
      there was much meowing and pacing
      saw the doctor this morning about starting a more aggressive treatment of diabetes
      maybe see the Avengers movie this evening as movies here are $5
      to think I read comics growing up and now almost all of them are movies
</pre>

<pre>
yesterday was hot/humid, so I only finished one side of the porch ... two to go
probably should only work in the morning, which is possible now as I figured out
a way to not use the noisy saw as much, don't want to disturb the neighborhood
very little time spent on the computers yesterday, sweet
my very old neighbor, well, older than me, keeps visiting and retelling the same stories
</pre>

<pre>
discoverd <a href="http://riemann.io/" target="_blank">Riemann</a> over the weekend ...
looks interesting so far, as does
<a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jcnc/2012/192913/" target="_blank">Holt-Winters anomaly detection</a>
anomaly detection, even with machine learning, is a <em>tough nut</em> in ids/ips
tired of <em>making fire</em> so must buy a gas bbq grill for chicken thighs, hamburgers, hot dogs, and veggies from the garden
sure, things won't taste as good as cooked over a fire, but <em>turning a knob and pressing a button</em> is so instantly gratifying
must finish screening in the porch, to sit outside without the skeeters eating me alive
maybe sleep out there at night, but I don't think <em>screen</em> is <b>bear</b> proof
hopefully I don't staple/hammer one of the neighbor's cats as they like to participate any time
I'm outside doing stuff
... they're totally useless coz all they do is rub up against your legs or lay down on the hammer
... cats around here aren't afraid of cars, they stand in front of mine or get underneath,
they cross the street without looking both ways ... I've warned them
once the porch is done I can enjoy a view of the surrounding mountains
... a joy after many years of living in SF/NY/DC with way too many people
or just stare at the neighbors as they back stare at me, lots of staring and waving around here
</pre>

<pre>
officially deprecate and stop all development on the
<a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/cellipede" target="_blank">Cellipede project</a>
prepare the hummingbird feeders ... they're fun to watch and cool with the whole torpor thing they do
</pre>

<pre>
As the weather is supposed to be nice, I'm keeping computer time to a minimum and
spending the day outside doing boring yard work.
Maybe even finish screening the porch before those skeeters arrive ... I think next
week is the start of a heat wave.
Well, I'm off to move heavy stuff around and buy some screws ... it seems I purchase
more than I construct.
With retirement just around the corner, less than 2 years now, I'm thinking of reversing
how life is lived.
Try to spend more time each day physically moving around, walking/jogging/playing, and
less time sitting in front of a computer.
Sure, I enjoy computers/programming but too much time with them is not healthy.
Growing up I was fidgety and always on the move, but once I discovered programming that changed.
I stopped running long distances and playing tennis which I was once good enough at to play in college.
Just thinking ... but I guess everyone thinks about returning to their youth sometimes.
</pre>

<pre>
May is here and we're springing into summer, so some spring clean up is needed.
final ideas for Cellipede, but I probably won't implement these:
create a generic endpoint to handle any function
the endpoint should behave like ruby's <b>method missing</b>

create a Cellipede api-only version just for function execution
<br />
with no UI, no javascript/html/css, no database
... this is easy due to the app's design, thank me :-)
<br />
... just the function endpoints
... keeping it a small/fast code base (sinatra-like)
... and run it on Heroku


use the above for other purposes than seo, it's dead remember, stuff
... just don't document the hidden functions so the app doesn't get abused yet I can use it

add code to throttle requests avoiding HTTP DOS attacks

all of the above just happens to coincide with the new features
that are <em>coming soon</em> to Rails 5, which puts more emphasis
on using rails as a back-end api server with Ember/whatever in front

the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLZvOKSCkxY" target="_blank">NLTK series</a>
by sentdex has caught my eye, and his Scikit-learn series was great
... it's refreshing to see good design/coding/testing even if he's not a professional programming
but has invested the time to learn enough to do a great job with great videos

an idea for a new project came to me this morning, but I won't reveal it here
- it's always best to begin in a private github repo or local repo to avoid premature judgements,
then, maybe, go public/open-source once somewhat sure
- a python/flask app
- just RESTful api, no UI, see:
<a href="http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask" target="_blank">restful</a>
or
<a href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/en/0.3.2/index.html" target="_blank">flask-restful</a>

the Amazon Fire TV arrived today, and I could do a useless <em>unboxing video</em> but I'll
leave that to the advertising/marketing types
- it works great, almost as small as a Raspberry Pi
- maybe, at last, I can cut the cable company cord, well, for TV at least
- <em>knock on wood</em>, but this area has the fastest internet service I've ever experienced,
and that includes D.C. and New York city and other places that I have lived before
&nbsp;&nbsp;... it's amazing and I wonder why, maybe, being in the mountains
we have the <em>high ground</em>

spent some time learning about Action Cable and websockets coming in Rails 5 ... interesting

in the evening's twilight, I sat on the porch and shot my pistol and rifle at some rain drops,
not sure I hit any, but
it's fun to aim at stuff ... I'm not a hunter unless going to Food Lion counts, I just
like aiming at stuff (not animals)

<pre>
create a python/scapy daemon to watch/count recurring hosts/ips within a given timeframe
this will see all hosts/ips on the nic and not just the ones that match a signature in snort/suricata
</pre>

<pre>
revive Uni2Espy on github: https://github.com/cleesmith/uni2espy
which processes unified2 files from snort/suricata/whatever and indexes them into Elasticsearch
