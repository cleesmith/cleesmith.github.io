<h2 class="section-heading">hospital &nbsp;<small>Thursday, March 30, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I spent yesterday evening in the car parked just outside a nearby hospital.&nbsp; Something often 
  done over the years, personally it resonates with me more than graves and cemeteries.&nbsp;
  I have been rereading a book I retrieved from storage:
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578632978/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">
    People Who Don't Know They're Dead: How They Attach Themselves to Unsuspecting Bystanders and What to Do About It
  </a> 
  &nbsp;<small>by Gary Leon Hill</small> -- I will be writing a review of this book.&nbsp;
  Unfortunately, I have never had any coherent conversations like described in the book.&nbsp;  Most of what I 
  have experienced over the years have been feelings, intuitions, and emotions.&nbsp;  For me, it's more of 
  subtle experience.&nbsp;  Obviously there 
  is a lot of death at hospitals, and some of those people are uncertain and confused about what 
  has happened to them.&nbsp;  In other words, they never prepared to die.&nbsp;  Probably never even 
  thought about death very much, and like most people were too busy just living each day.&nbsp;  So I 
  try to offer assistance by being nearby and projecting outward feelings of comfort.&nbsp;  I believe 
  it is a helpful and useful thing to do, but I am not "keeping score" so any benefit to myself 
  is at best intangible -- other than the knowledge I gain about dying, death, and spirit in 
  preparation for my own imminent death.&nbsp;
</p>
<blockquote>We all got it coming.&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>
  While I do consider myself to be like a psychopomp, obviously I'm not a crow nor an angel nor Anubis 
  as often depicted in ancient stories.&nbsp;  Since I have never had clear conversations with the newly 
  deceased this probably means I'm more of a psychopomp-lite.&nbsp;  I am very skeptical of anyone calling 
  themselves a "medium" as a lot of them have been debunked over the years.&nbsp;  In my experience the 
  "conversations" are more about emotions and feelings.&nbsp;
  As in, me trying to exude feelings of "you're ok" because "you're dead" -- it's ok 
  and normal and natural and nothing to fear or to be confused about.&nbsp;  What I do is a bit like 
  someone who <b>truly listens to someone else</b>.&nbsp;  Just listen without giving any advice or judgments, 
  but only offer comfort by being there.&nbsp;  Basically I try to be something that is familiar thereby 
  lending some comfort.&nbsp;  It's an act of giving.&nbsp;  It always amazes me how well I sleep after spending 
  an evening near a hospital and the newly dead.&nbsp;  Peaceful and relaxing in some way.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">becoming a psychopomp &nbsp;<small>circa 1976</small></h2>
<p>
  For nine months in the year 1976 I worked in a hospital emergency room.&nbsp;  Needless to say 
  there were a lot of deaths.&nbsp;  Mostly violent: gunshots, stabbings, and vehicle accidents.&nbsp; 
  My job was security (I was armed with a pistol), monitoring drug access, and having access to 
  the morgue (keys to everything).&nbsp;  I often used gurneys to take the dead to be refrigerated in 
  the morgue, and transfer their body to a drawer in the refrigerator.&nbsp;
  Other times I would assist with procedures like spinal taps.&nbsp;  These taps were often done 
  on people that seemed out of their mind (batshit crazy) and had to be restrained.&nbsp;  It's amazing how 
  strong they can be when in that state of mind, so anyone who could grab a leg or arm was needed.&nbsp; I'm 
  guessing you can't just anesthetize someone without knowing what's wrong with them, and a spinal 
  tap sure looked painful.&nbsp;  So it seemed like everyday was filled with pain, suffering, death, 
  and lots of crazy people just wanting attention from anyone.  
</p>
<p>
  Amongst all of this is when I started to notice certain feelings and presences (for lack of a better word).&nbsp;  
  Back then I was in my early twenties and still quite naive, so I knew nothing about necromancy, 
  psychopomp, and spirits.&nbsp;  All I knew back then was that I loved women, cars, shooting guns, partying, with
  some reading and writing sprinkled in sometimes.&nbsp; This was how I began my more than 40 years long journey 
  into learning about death, practicing necromancy, and becoming a psychopomp.&nbsp;
