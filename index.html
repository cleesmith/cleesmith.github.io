the beauty of Ruby and what few people understand ... simplified:
- <b>1.class</b> means <b>1</b> is an <b>object</b> whose <b>class</b> is Fixnum
- <b>Fixnum.instance_methods(false)</b> reveals this object to have these methods [:to_s, :+, :-, :==, etc], so
- <b>1.to_s</b> is really 1.send(:to_s) and <b>1 + 1</b> is really 1.send(:+, 1)
- yes, <b>send</b> is just passing a <b>message</b> to an <b>object</b>
- of course, I don't need to know about <em>sending messages to objects</em> just to do <b>1 + 1</b>
Ruby is an absolute beauty and why I say it's <b>manna from heaven</b>, ok, Japan actually.
Of course, it may be more beautiful to have a language like Smalltalk with only 6 keywords and no conditionals ... true OO
</pre>

<pre>
always apply these ideas from Sandi Metz:
<b>be Smalltalk infected</b>
<b>be Condition averse</b> (when possible avoid if/else/case/unless)
<b>be Message centric</b>
  - don't own the behavoir of an object
  - null object pattern
  - composition ... beware of always using inheritance, it's not for sharing behavoir
  - independency injection for behavior
<b>be Abstraction seeking</b>
* see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE" target="_blank">Sandi Metz</a> and her book is great too
For the most part, my projects accomplish each of the **be**'s above.

mini-rants
- if you have a project that you consider to be <b>intellectual property</b>
... that's great, but keep it to yourself, maybe a private repo, until you're ready to
<b>gift your little wonder</b> to the world
- open source is not <b>intellectual property</b>, and best explained by Remy Sharp:
"
Welcome. Welcome to this code I wrote.
Help yourself to bits you like or need.
Help make it better for others.
Help make it yours.
Help make me better with your suggestions, changes or discussion.
Use the code in any way you want, in ways I never thought of.
And if the projects I created lives on without me, then open source has worked.
"
... if you don't understand the above then you just don't understand github or open source software.
</pre>

<pre>
* learn Clojure and Elixir
* return to Smalltalk more often
* Rails, given the <b>monkey-patched mess</b> it's become, will be the ruin of Ruby ... bummer, as I used Ruby before Rails came along, and, often, it will put a <b>smile on your face</b>
* Python ... well, why, if you have Ruby? ... well, ok, maybe for nltk, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and numpy ... so ok, maybe sometimes you want to <b>wax nostalgic</b> and relive the days of gigantic loops, with lots of sideways
pyramid-style indented code, and if-else's the size of Montana (you know, big) ... just to remind yourself of how nice OO can be
* Java ... no way am I going back there ... although Elasticsearch is really impressive
* Emacs Lisp, maybe, I like Lisp, but I use vim most of the time
* regarding editors: on a daily basis I use vim, sublime, textmate, nano, and notepad ...  and I type so blazingly fast in all of them that I don't need any macro's/whatever's for repeated actions/tasks/whatevers, just keep on truckin' ... I'm <b>chicken chasin'</b> fast and no <b>Kentucky fried idiot</b> ... oh yeah, stay humble, IMHO

revive <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/uni2espy" target="_blank">Uni2Espy</a>, which processes unified2 files from snort/suricata/whatever and indexes them into Elasticsearch
