  This song is often playing in the morning when I wake up.&nbsp; 
  This youtube video is on <b>loop</b>, but I have no memory of doing it:

<blockquote>
  White label on the backseat<br />
  Glows an artificial green<br />
  <u><b>I crave a midnight something</b></u><br />
  I crave and something hunts me down<br />
  I'm scaring everybody<br />
  I'm wearing everybody down<br />
  <br />
  White label on the backseat<br />
  And <u><b>something bends me over, down</b></u><br />
  <u><b>I crave an empty lifestyle</b></u><br />
  I crave the very loudest sound<br />
  I'm chasing everybody<br />
  I'm shaking everybody down<br />
  Do you hear the loudest sound?<br />
  And you and me in the echo?<br />
  <br />
  White label on the backseat<br />
  And something warm across my lap<br />
  I never bitched at anyone<br />
  I never asked for my heart back<br />
  I'm loving everybody<br />
  And <u><b>hating everyone I see</b></u><br />
  Do you still remember me?<br />

<h2 class="section-heading">being a sleepwalker &nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 1, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I am a <b>sleepwalker</b>.  Sometimes I look like a zombie when I watch the footage from the motion detection cameras.&nbsp; 
  Since I can't control the sleepwalking, it has always been a source of shame and embarrassment.&nbsp; 
  In college everyone in the dorms thought it was hilarious, as I was often found outside totally naked.&nbsp; 
  There was even a picture in the local newspaper, well, with my privates redacted.&nbsp; Not exactly the kind 
  of fame anyone is looking for, at least any girl looking out their dorm window got a good look at a 
  future prospect.&nbsp; 
  My first wife, met her at college by the way, often said she preferred sex with my sleepwalking self as
  "that other guy was a better lover".&nbsp; Funny, but maybe she wasn't kidding.&nbsp; 
  My second wife thought sleepwalking was very creepy, which seems to be the most common reaction.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  When I bought this minimalist house I added very loud alarms on the doors and windows to wake me.&nbsp; 
  Because one time I saw myself on an outdoor security camera holding a pistol and getting into
  the car.&nbsp; Luckily I did not go anywhere.&nbsp; But I seem more capable than the experts claim 
  on the various websites I've read.&nbsp; Also, the sleepwalking seems to have increased as I've gotten older,
  which is the opposite of what the experts say.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  I have installed many motion detection IR cameras in many rooms to record any sleepwalking activities.&nbsp; 
  I have hundreds of these videos.&nbsp; It is weird to watch yourself doing things you don't remember.&nbsp; 
  There are two recurring behaviors:<br />
  <ol>
    <li>
      I send myself emails that always say something like:<br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      "<i>i will never forgive you</i>" but always misspelled like: "<i>no 4give u</i>", "<i>n'er forgue yu</i>", and so on
    </li>
    <li>
      I light candles and walk around while holding them, yet I never bump into anything.&nbsp; 
      But when I'm awake I'm always bumping into things.
    </li>
  </ol>
  I tried to share these on YouTube, but there were many nasty comments so I deleted them.&nbsp; Plus it 
  was a lot of work to edit and piece together in the proper order footage from several video cameras.&nbsp; 
  Perhaps this is something that shouldn't be shared with the world.&nbsp; The first thing I do each morning 
  is to watch any captured video footage.&nbsp; It's my own private YouTube, except the "<i>You</i>" appears 
  to be someone else in possession of my body.&nbsp; The <i>sleepwalking me</i> is extremely fond of masturbating, 
  which is not something I want to watch ever--much less the first thing in the morning.&nbsp; WTF, will 
  I never run out of gism?
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, I will chain myself while in bed to avoid doing something horrible, like taking a gun and shooting 
  someone or driving the car without being awake.&nbsp;  Actually, the <b>chain</b> is a synthetic strap that loops 
  through an anchor bolt in the floor, and I am handcuffed to that -- sounds kinky, huh?&nbsp; 
  No, it's not my own private <i>fifty shades</i> of whatever.&nbsp; Since I keep a pistol under my 
  pillow (<i>who doesn't?</i>), there's always a chance that my sleepwalking self will kill me.&nbsp; Is that 
  murder or suicide or both?&nbsp; Either way, I'm fully prepared to testify under oath that <i>he</i> did it.&nbsp;
