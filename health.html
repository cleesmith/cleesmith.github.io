<h2 class="section-heading">Pen and Paper</h2>
<p>
Another good habit that has been key to losing weight and feeling better is counting calories.
I bought a cheap, small notebook and sharpie pen to keep in the kitchen near where I eat.
Don't bother counting the exact calorie intake, read the label and round up the number a bit.
So each day I have a record of what I ate and about how many calories consumed. I have tried to stay
within 1,400 to 1,800 each day. Some days I am more hungry than others. So far this has
worked great, as I have lost 1-2 pounds per week -- losing 70 pounds since
May 2015. Now, that is probably too much too fast, but I think it is typical to lose
more when first starting new diet and exercise habits. So I am prepared for this
to become more difficult and slower as time goes on.
<span class="caption text-muted">
There is no getting around the fact that <b>calories consumed</b> dictate <b>your weight</b> -- it's the plain, simple, truth.
</span>
Because I have diabetes type 2, I do limit the carbs I eat per day. Also, buy some
dumbbells, like 10-15 pounds, and do some repetitions every other day. No, you
don't have to look like the Rock(Dwayne Johnson), but it will help with fat
burning as well being less flabby as you lose weight. Don't over do it with
the dumbbells, as a little goes a long way -- especially at first.
</p>
<p>
Buy one of those pedometers that you clip on your shoe, and shoot for
5,000 (2 miles = 200 calories) to 10,000 (4 miles = 400 calories) steps every today.
It is not that the exercise really burns that many calories, but it will make
you feel better. Also, make a note of what you did each day in your notebook -- positive
feedback, which sounds silly but it works.
</p>
<p>
I recently got the results of a blood test from the doctor. And after doing all of the
aforementioned life changes, the results were amazing. My A1C, triglycerides, etc. are all back to normal.
This has all changed since the <i>way-over-the-top</i> readings back in mid May 2015.
I really did not believe that the suggestions of the doctor and nutritionist would actually work.
I've always believed that you had to exercise to near exhaustion, i.e. nauseated, every
day to get and stay in shape -- I had that runner's mentality.
</p>
<p>
But their suggestions have worked with just walking and paying attention to what I eat every day.
<span class="caption text-muted">Repeating these life style changes almost every day is the key to success.</span>
Both the doctor and nutritionist seemed very surprised that I actually listened and followed
their advice. Apparently most people do not. While most people probably want
to feel better, they just don't or can't make it a habit for some reason. Hopefully,
I don't backslide, as they say, too much -- although pizza is seriously calling my
name especially on Fridays, and sometimes there's a ringing sound of tacos from Taco Bell,
or one of those huge burritos from Chipotle -- a 1,200+ calorie behemoth with 100+ carbs,
which should come with a side order of heart bypass surgery or a coffin ... but they are so awesome.
<span class="caption text-muted">
Every now and then it is ok to cut yourself a break -- indulge for a day.
</span>

At last, a rainy day. No walking today. Besides my feet are sore from all of the miles and miles.
They need a day off. Enjoy it. The rest of this week is dry and filled with miles.
</p>
<p>
We all know that marketing is lies. Anytime I return to watching cable tv, like a football game,
I am immediately reminded of this fact.
Marketing is loud and in your face -- thankfully there is a mute button.
Is this what we have become?
Well, it seems the answer is yes, at least in America --
where we no longer invent or make things any more -- we just market and talk, i.e. lie.
Sad.
</p>
<p>
A simple example is a so-called sports drink.
Look at the ingredients in Gatorade for example:
<ul>
<li>water -- that's good</li>
<li>sugar -- not good</li>
<li>high fructose corn syrup -- wtf? I think they removed this one</li>
<li>dextrose -- sugar by another name?</li>
<li>brominated vegetable oil -- again, wtf?</li>
<li>various gum's -- chewy?</li>
</ul>
... puddle water is better for you.
The lie in the marketing is that this drink helps your energy, hydration, and recovery.
Hello, it's sugar water with other crap in it.
Which is ok if you have the metabolism of a hummingbird.
If you want sugar water then put some sugar in your water -- and even better give
that to a hummingbird.
</p>

I will stick with water, an occassional coconut water, green tea, and coffee -- but mostly water.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Spiced Cluck Maybe</h2>
<p>
Food idea for today is chicken tenders.
No, not breaded and deep fried -- sounds good, but just stay healthy.
Let's grill them ... fire it up!
While the grill is heating up, slather chicken in olive oil, then sprinkle on some
basil, garlic/onion powder, salt, black pepper -- use your spice imagination here.
Grill each side for 4 minutes.
Do a double check, cut one open and check for pink. Pink bad, so grill more.
Maybe put them on a salad or just dive in with a fork.
Simple but oh so good ... please, no lip smacking, respect the chickens.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Healthy Pie Maybe</h2>
<p>
Writing and editing is an addiction -- it's worst with blogs and instant publishing.

Today's weather, ignoring the humidity, seems a prelude to
autumn and inevitably winter. I feel compelled to walk
more while I can. I do not look forward to winter and
that stationary bike -- as walking does not really seem
like exercising but more like a moving meditation. Especially after a year of walking 5+ miles
everyday. That's over 1,800 miles and about 360,000 calories burned,
but that does not mean very much as it is easy to eat 200 calories (about a mile).
For example, a small can of peanuts is well over 1,000 calories.

Perhaps someone can invent a tiny Raspberry Pi that we could
swallow, well, say in some raspberry pie. It could monitor our
overall health -- count calories in/out, real-time blood/urine work, etc.
-- then make recommendations and adjustments accordingly, such as:
<span class="caption text-muted">"go see the doc, dummy" or "no! you're not hungry" or "your pee smells bad"</span>
HealthyPi, swallow it today.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Odd Viewpoint Maybe</h2>
<p>
As odd as it is to say, having diabetes type-2 is kind of a blessing in disguise. WTF?
By that I mean if you pay attention while trying to lessen the effects of diabetes, you
can really get to know how "your" body works. For example, I use to run a lot and
since that burns tons of calories I did not really pay attention to what I was eating.
Like those pre-marathon dinners with huge amounts of pasta and spaghetti -- tasty but not
really good for a body. When I stopped running due to a knee injury (not serious just
too painful to run) and continued with the poor eating habits, guess what, you gain
weight. But worse your whole body goes whacky. My idea of exercise was running until
I wanted to puke. Manly -- right? -- wrong! It turns out that lesser exercises, such as
walking, really do have an effect on your body. Currently I'm walking from 4 to 6 miles
every day, and sometimes take a break on Sunday's -- i.e. a less exercise day allows for some recovery.
Who knew that using slow twitch muscles was exercise, after all we are designed to walk all day
long if our feet and back did not get sore. So walking never seemed like real exercise to me.
But after doing this for several months, my blood pressure is now within a normal range
and my blood sugar (with medication) is close to normal.
<span class="caption text-muted">
Overall, I feel much better and stronger.
</span>
I even learned a new programming called Go -- so my brain is working better too.
I have learned a lot about calories, carbohydrates, fats, and supermarkets. As for supermarkets,
most of the space is devoted to foods we should not eat. Like starches, which turn to sugar
almost the moment you swallow them, with nothing good in them for anyone. Sure pasta and mashed
potatoes taste great, just not great for you, but it is hard to turn down those traditional
foods during those holiday meals with family.
So it is all about being disciplined or giving in to feeling lousy and weak. It's all been
insightful and interesting.
The hard part will be making this new life style into a habit over the long haul, and given that
the diabetes horror stories are true that should be enough motivation. Who wants to go blind or
lose a leg or kidneys. Sure, as you get older things will break so diet and exercise are not
going to fix everything. But I think feeling better is a good thing, and so is a good nights sleep due in
large part to the exercise.
<span class="caption text-muted">
Feeling better is not the same as being happy. But what is happy?
</span>
<span class="caption text-muted">
As many have said before, <b>happy is something you decide to be</b> and not something you can find or
pursue -- silly declaration of independence.
</span>
<span class="caption text-muted">
So, for me, happy it will be while feeling better too.
