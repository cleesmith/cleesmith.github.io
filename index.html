<pre>
the beauty of Ruby and what few people understand ... simplified:
- <b>1.class</b> means <b>1</b> is an <b>object</b> whose <b>class</b> is Fixnum
- <b>Fixnum.instance_methods(false)</b> reveals this object to have these methods [:to_s, :+, :-, :==, etc], so
- <b>1.to_s</b> is really 1.send(:to_s) and <b>1 + 1</b> is really 1.send(:+, 1)
- yes, <b>send</b> is just passing a <b>message</b> to an <b>object</b>
- of course, I don't need to know about <em>sending messages to objects</em> just to do <b>1 + 1</b>
absolute beauty and why I say it's <b>manna from heaven</b>, ok, actually Japan
but it may be more beautiful to have a language like Smalltalk with only 6 keywords and no conditionals ... true OO

can't remember where I got these but every developer should be more:
<b>Smalltalk infected</b>
<b>Condition averse</b> (avoid if/else/case)
<b>Message centric</b>
  - don't own the behavoir of an object
  - null object pattern
  - composition ... beware of always using inheritance, it's not for sharing behavoir
  - independency injection for behavior
<b>Abstraction seeking</b>
</pre>

#### notes
* there is nothing new or original in anything this code does:
  * scraping an html page has been going on for years
  * fetching counts from facebook/twitter/whatever has also been done many times before
  * all of these simple seo functions have been around for years
  * creating spreadsheets whether they be for excel or google drive have been done before
  * anyone who says otherwise ... is, well, selling you snake oil
* this project was coded for a friend who could not find anything that was fast/reliable, and she tried many open source projects, including pipulate which I semi-recommended but which she quickly rejected for several reasons I won't mention here ... however, this project let's her specify what she desires in the yaml file and quickly get the results, maybe rinse/repeat a few times, then enhance into a report using excel
* this was also a bit of an experiment, as well as a teaching tool, for practical object-oriented design/coding ... in ruby at least
* I tried to apply these ideas from Sandi Metz
  * see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE and her book is great too
  * be **Smalltalk** infected
  * be **Condition** adverse
  * be **Message** centric
  * be **Abstraction** seeking
  * I think, for the most part, this project accomplished each of the **be**'s

#### mini-rants
* if you have a project that you consider to be **intellectual property** ... that's great, but keep it to yourself, maybe a private repo, until you're ready to **gift your little wonder** to the world
* there is no **intellectual property** here, as this is open source and best explained by Remy Sharp:
```
Welcome. Welcome to this code I wrote.
Help yourself to bits you like or need.
Help make it better for others.
Help make it yours.
Help make me better with your suggestions, changes or discussion.
Use the code in any way you want, in ways I never thought of.
And if the projects I created lives on without me, then open source has worked.
```
... if you don't understand the above then you just don't get github or open source software.

<pre>
* learn Clojure and Elixir
* return to Smalltalk more often
* Rails, given the **monkey-patched mess** it's become, will be the ruin of Ruby ... bummer, as I used Ruby before Rails came along, and, often, it will put a **smile on your face**
* Python ... well, why, if you have Ruby? ... well, ok, maybe for nltk, pandas, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and numpy ... so ok, maybe sometimes you want to **wax nostalgic** and relive the days of gigantic loops, with lots of sideways pyramid-style indented code, and if-else's the size of Montana (you know, big) ... just to remind yourself of how nice OO can be
* Java ... no way am I going back there ... although Elasticsearch is really impressive
* Emacs Lisp, maybe, I like Lisp, but I use vim most of the time
* regarding editors: on a daily basis I use vim, sublime, textmate, nano, and notepad ...  and I type so blazingly fast in all of them that I don't need any macro's/whatever's for repeated actions/tasks/whatevers, just keep on truckin' ... I'm **chicken chasin'** fast and no **Kentucky fried idiot** ... oh yeah, stay humble, IMHO
