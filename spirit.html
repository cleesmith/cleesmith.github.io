<h2 class="section-heading">hospital &nbsp;<small>Thursday, March 30, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I spent yesterday evening in the car parked just outside a nearby hospital. Something often 
  done over the years, personally it resonates with me more than graves and cemeteries.
  I have been rereading a book I retrieved from storage:
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578632978/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank">
    People Who Don't Know They're Dead: How They Attach Themselves to Unsuspecting Bystanders and What to Do About It
  </a> 
  &nbsp;<small>by Gary Leon Hill</small> ... I will be writing a review of this book.
  Unfortunately, I have never had any coherent conversations like described in the book.  Most of what I 
  have experienced over the years has been feelings, intuitions, and emotions.  For me, it's more of 
  subtle experience.  Obviously there 
  is a lot of death at hospitals, and some of those people are uncertain and confused about what 
  has happened to them.  In other words, they never prepared to die.  Probably never even 
  thought about death very much, and like most people were too busy just living each day.  So I 
  try to offer assistance by being nearby and projecting outward feelings of comfort.  I believe 
  it is a helpful and useful thing to do, but I am not "keeping score" so any benefit to myself 
  is at best intangible.
</p>
<p>
  While I do consider myself to be like a psychopomp, obviously I'm not a crow nor an angel nor Anubis 
  as often depicted in ancient stories.  Since I have never had clear conversations with the newly 
  deceased this probably means I'm more of a psychopomp-lite.  Simply put, the "conversations" are more 
  emotional.  As in, me exuding a feeling of "you're ok" because "you're dead" ... it's ok 
  and normal and natural and nothing to fear or be confused about.  What I do is a bit like 
  someone who truly listens to someone else.  Without giving any advice or judgments, but only 
  comfort.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">becoming a psychopomp &nbsp;<small>circa 1976</small></h2>
<p>
  For nine months in the year 1976 I worked in a hospital emergency room.  Needless to say 
  there were a lot of deaths.  Mostly violent: gunshots, stabbings, and vehicle accidents. 
  My job was security (I was armed with a pistol), monitoring drug access, and having access to 
  the morgue (keys to everything).  I often used gurneys to take the dead to be refrigerated in 
  the morgue, and transfer their body to a drawer in the refrigerator.
  Other times I would assist with procedures like spinal taps.  These taps were often done 
  on people that seemed out of their mind (batshit crazy) and had to be restrained.  It's amazing how 
  strong they can be when in that state of mind, so anyone who could grab a leg or arm was needed. I'm 
  guessing you can't just anesthetize someone without knowing what's wrong with them, and a spinal 
  tap sure looked painful.  So it seemed like everyday was filled with pain, suffering, death, 
  and lots of crazy people just wanting attention from anyone.  
</p>
<p>
  Amongst all of this is when I started to notice certain feelings and presences (for lack of a better word).  
  Back then I was in my early twenties and still quite naive, so I knew nothing about necromancy, 
  psychopomp, and spirits.  All I knew back then was that I loved women, cars, shooting guns, partying, with
  some reading and writing sprinkled in sometimes.
