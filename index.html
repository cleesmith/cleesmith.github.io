<h2 id="writing" class="section-heading">Writing&nbsp;
  <small>Wednesday, February 14, 2018</small></h2>
<p>
Why do I write in journals so much?&nbsp; 
Why do I buy so many journals and then fill them with words?&nbsp;
Am I a writer?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because I don't 
approach writing as a craft, nor do I wish to write a book or 
anything that gets published.&nbsp; To be honest, I have 
found that writing so much makes me feel sad, not depressed, 
just sad from possibly too much introspection.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
There is a recurring dream where I write an autobiography, but 
not as a <i>story</i> that's interesting to read rather just 
a series of essays based on each year of my life.&nbsp; The 
first essay would be the year 1955, and so on, and obviously 
the first five or six years would be hearsay since I don't 
actually remember much from those years.&nbsp; Why do this?&nbsp; 
Perhaps looking back on one's life is just something everyone 
wants to do as they face death.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="2018" class="section-heading">Look ahead to 2018&nbsp;
  <small>Saturday, January 6, 2018</small></h2>
<p>
I want to spend some time "staring at" the decks collected in 2017.&nbsp; 
Also, spend more time doing art and reading.&nbsp; Definitely 
continue running/walking but remember to add in some "off days" to help the body recover ... I'm no spring chicken.&nbsp; Continue to enjoy the "tarot community" but don't fall prey to buying more decks or readings.&nbsp; Unsubscribe from many of the 
folk so they no longer appear in my subscriptions feed, i.e. 
remove the temptation to buy ... my collecting days are over.&nbsp; 
Keep in mind that while spiritually 
oriented people, tarot community folk are still just people.&nbsp; So they are just as fickle, quirky, opinionated, and jerks the 
same as the programmer community folk were ... people are people.&nbsp; In other words, continue to keep your opinions to 
yourself, because it's no fun and a waste of time to get caught up in flame wars.&nbsp; <br>
In a nutshell:
<ul>
<li>make less YouTube videos, at least less tarot ones
<li>walk and run but in moderation
<li>play with new decks
<li>do art
<li>do writing
<li>less YouTube, Facebook, and internet ... this will 
probably take care of itself given that "net neutrality" 
is gone, so now ISP's will charge extra for the popular 
websites which means I will drop the internet
</ul>
</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="2017" class="section-heading">Looking back on 2017&nbsp;
  <small>Saturday, January 6, 2018</small></h2>
<p>
Starting in June 2017 I began to add some running to my 
daily walking.&nbsp; At this point, I can run 4 to 5 miles 
everyday as well as some weight lifting and lots of stretching.&nbsp; My core, stomach area, is much stronger and flatter ... 
muscles are visible again, at long last.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
From May to December 2017 I collected a lot of oracle and 
tarot decks.&nbsp; To be honest, my overall feeling is one 
of being disappointed.&nbsp; The artwork on many of the 
cards is definitely not worth the cost.&nbsp; The struggles 
with shipping delays/losses from Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and 
individual creators was a huge disappointment.&nbsp; That 
was not always the case, but it happened a lot more than 
I expected.&nbsp; So, again, I was disappointed.&nbsp; In 
the end, I did not spend all of the money I had set aside 
for buying new decks ... basically, I became bored with 
the whole process of collecting decks.&nbsp; In a way I 
will miss the "a package is coming" experience, as others 
have said, but I will get over that.&nbsp;

<p>
  The year 2017 is devoted to collecting all sorts of cards/decks: magic, oracle, and tarot.&nbsp; 
  For over 60 years I have been using only two decks that were given to me: the usual yellow box RWS deck,
  and the Albano deck.&nbsp; I love them both.&nbsp; But this year 
  I wanted to <i>see</i> what all is out there, in terms of books and decks.&nbsp; It has been 
  fun with the added bonus of finding a very welcoming tarot community on YouTube.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="decks" class="section-heading">tracking decks&nbsp;<small>Saturday, September 2, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I spent some time today cutting/pasting from YouTube playlists to create a list of 
  the tarot and oracle decks I own.

<h2 id="more_crystal_conflict" class="section-heading">more crystal conflict&nbsp;<small>Saturday, May 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Even though I am very conflicted in my mind about buying crystals, several times I have made road trips to 
  <a href="https://www.jimcolemancrystals.com/" target="_blank">Jim Coleman Crystal Mines and Rock Shop</a> 
  in Arkansas.&nbsp; If you <b>resonant</b> with quartz crystals then this is the place to touch and 
  feel them.&nbsp; It's amazing.&nbsp; It's also extremely expensive.&nbsp; Their website is old school, slow, and 
  it's odd how they use both a tape measure and a Coca Cola can to give you an idea about the size of the crystal.&nbsp; 
  While I have purchased crystals online, it really doesn't make sense to do that.&nbsp; After all, crystals 
  are about <b>feel</b>, so if you can't touch them you just can't tell much about them from a photo.&nbsp; Sure, 
  not everyone in the world is blessed enough to be able to drive to some geniune crystal mine or store.&nbsp; 
  So you're stuck with ordering online, which is ok.&nbsp; But I am still conflicted about owning them, yet 
  it's become a habit I can't break.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="crystal_conflict" class="section-heading">crystal conflict&nbsp;<small>Wednesday, May 3, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Over the years I have collected many crystals.&nbsp; Especially quartz, clear and otherwise.&nbsp; However, 
  I often feel conflicted about buying and owning crystals that have been mined from mother earth.&nbsp; The 
  vast majority of crystals have been mined in a greedy manner.&nbsp; And mining from the earth's perspective is rape.&nbsp; 
  After all, crystals are not a necessity for humans--we don't eat them.&nbsp; So why do so many people, 
  including me, collect them?&nbsp; We're human.&nbsp; We rape, pilage, and plunder.&nbsp; It's what we do.&nbsp; Sad.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  The following video puts a positive spin on the mining that occurs in Spruce Pine, North Carolina.&nbsp; I 
  was born and raised in North Carolina, about two hours away from Spruce Pine.&nbsp; Just look at how 
  damaging the mining process is to those beautiful mountains.&nbsp; The narrator just casually mentions all 
  the acids and processing involved in extracting some of the 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz#Occurrence" target="_blank">world's most pure quartz</a>.&nbsp; 
  I am not judging nor trying to offend the person that made this video, in any way, instead it is enlightening 
  to see the effects of mineral and crystal mining and I am thankful for this video.&nbsp; 
  One can only imagine how much damage is done in a more remote location like Brazil.&nbsp; Hence my reason 
  for being conflicted about crystals.&nbsp; Another reason I feel conflicted, especially about quartz, is that 
  without the mining of quartz in places like Spruce Pine I would not have had a career in computer programming.&nbsp; 
  No silicon, no computers, it's that simple.&nbsp;

<h2 id="insomnia" class="section-heading">insomnia&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 27, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Insomnia has been a problem my entire life.&nbsp; Usually I try to fall asleep while watching TV.&nbsp; 
  Some say that's why you have insomnia, but for many years I have tried falling asleep in a 
  totally quiet bedroom.&nbsp; That doesn't work for me, as I would just lay there with a gazillion 
  thoughts dancing through my mind.&nbsp; I discovered that if I listen to someone narrating a 
  particularly boring topic I will fall asleep.&nbsp; Most of the narrators that help have British accents.&nbsp; 
  Or they speak slowly and deliberately.&nbsp; These were hard to find on cable TV, also I <i>cut 
  the cord</i> many years ago--you know, hundreds of channels and <i>nothing on</i>.&nbsp; 
  So now I have amazon prime TV and mostly watch youtube.&nbsp; 
  But the only videos I can find on youtube that make me fall asleep are about WWII, Hitler, and Stalin.&nbsp; 
  These don't have commercial ad's and usually the audio volume is consistent and not too loud.&nbsp; 
  So I fall asleep.&nbsp; But the <i>same ole same ole</i> gets old, and variety is the spice of life, right?&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  I decided to try to make some of my own.&nbsp; It kind of works, but I don't have a British accent nor 
  do I have any oration skills.&nbsp; Yes, I have tried all of those videos that are intended to make 
  one relax like: fires, beaches, rain storms, ASMR, and so on.&nbsp; They don't work for me.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  However, while trying to do really long videos I noticed something.&nbsp; If I lower the resolution(720) 
  and frames per second(30) on a GoPro Hero4 Silver and compress them using Handbrake, the file sizes 
  are tiny and the upload to youtube is really fast.&nbsp; For example, a 2 hour video compressed down from 
  20GB to 400MB and uploaded in about 12 minutes.&nbsp; A huge difference.&nbsp; 
  Yet, they still look pretty decent, not HD, but not unwatchable.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">shadow monkey&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 15, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  While rereading a few older books, I've been thinking about our <b>shadow selves</b>.&nbsp; 
  Yep, we all have one.&nbsp; We're human.&nbsp; While I disagree with a lot of things the creator of 
  the following video spouts in other videos, this video is an excellent presentation:
  <br /><br />
  <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3I7TKW_QQbA" allowfullscreen></iframe>
  </div>
  <br />
  Usually when researching our shadow self Freud, Jung, and psychology will inevitably appear.&nbsp; While I've 
  read a lot of psychology, I am not a fan.&nbsp; A simple video like this, poetry really, sums up 
  a whole lot of what we know about ourselves.&nbsp; Well, when we are honest with ourselves.&nbsp; With 
  that said, I decided to transcribe the video into printed words.&nbsp; My apologies if I screwed up the 
  grammar or misspelled some words.&nbsp; I used 
  <a href="http://ccsubs.com/" target="_blank">ccSubs</a> to extract the words as a <b>.sbv</b> file, then I 
  wrote a Ruby program that uses 
  <a href="http://www.nokogiri.org/" target="_blank">Nokogiri</a> to remove the HTML and timestamps, 
  and ended up with this:

  <p>
There's a monkey, in your mind.<br /> 
You know what I'm talking about.<br /> 
Don't be shy, don't feel ashamed, or embarrassed.<br />
There's no need to deny it.<br />
We've all got one.<br /> 
Telling us what to do, what we want, what we don't want.<br /> 
<br />
I call mine, <b>Trevor</b>.<br />
<br />
Sometimes he seems small and harmless and fun to be around.<br />
Sometimes he seems big and powerful.<br /> 
A dangerous idiot.<br /> 
Who doesn't know his own strength, and whose real anger knows virtually no limits.<br /> 
I must never forget that he's there.<br />
Waiting to take control.<br /> 
<br />
Trevor wants; everything!<br />
<br />
Wherever I look, there's something that Trevor wants.<br /> 
I never asked for this, to always want is to never be at peace.<br /> 
Even when all you want is peace.<br /> 
<br />
Thanks for the shit sandwich, Trevor!<br />
<br />
Trevor chooses what I find attractive.<br /> 
Trevor chooses what team I support.<br />
Trevor makes most of my mistakes.<br />
Trevor makes me say stupid things and do stupid things.<br /> 
He makes me look a fool.<br /> 
He can blind me to the obvious.<br /> 
He is the giver of false impressions.<br /> 
He is my instinct, my subconscious.<br /> 
When Trevor gets cut off in traffic, I feel a moment where I know he'd like to take the wheel and run somebody off the road.<br />
Sometimes the effort of controlling him makes my heart pound.<br /> 
You'd think that I'd hate him.<br />
But I can't.<br /> 
<br />
I have to live with him.<br />
He and I, are one.<br /> 
<br />
I must make peace with him, and though I inherited from him all that I would change, what would life be without emotion.<br /> 
<br />
Whatever our common ancestor was, they were not so different.<br /> 
They had something like wonder, kindness, curiosity, courage, empathy, joy, the bond of friendship, a sense of humor, a sense of fun.<br /> 
Far from shame that where we came from, what we still struggle with, I can normally only wonder at how far we have come against cosmic odds.<br /> 
You may say I'm romanticizing.<br /> 
You just see a violent ape, or look down on humanity as pointless dust, and you'd be right.<br />
Both times.<br /> 
But that's the truth for you.<br />
There's more than one way to look at it and still be factually accurate.<br /> 
I see a <b>piece of universe</b> <i>[people]</i> in a daze, wondering what the hell is going on.<br /> 
With the unfortunate naturally evolved tendency to believe what it's told, and all too often latching on to the first answer it is given.<br /> 
<br />
And I pity it.<br /> 
One cannot hate, what one pities.<br /> 
<br />
Humans get a bum rap.<br /> 
To me, the human is what overcomes instinct, not what falls to it.<br /> 
You need to understand that emotions, instincts are far more often wrong than right.<br /> 
To survive within us they only need to be right, when they need to be right.<br /> 
How many times have you jumped at a harmless sound? 
Compared to the number of times that that instinct has saved your life.<br /> 
It must be thousands to one against.<br /> 
Instincts are frighteningly often wrong.<br /> 
But they're always there, pulling your strings shaping you.<br /> 
The fears, lusts, rage, bigotry, hatred, racism, greed, selfishness, judgmentalism.<br />
Trevor is very religious.<br /> 
Trevor needs constant reassurance, that's why Trevor's religious.<br />
<br />
It can't be healthy to deny the obvious.<br />
<br />
There's a short-tempered, idiotic, small-minded, judgemental, egocentric, easily tempted, paranoid, bigoted, mind monkey in your head.<br /> 
And it's scared.<br /> 
And it's confused.<br /> 
And it's ashamed of its body.<br /> 
And it's ashamed of its nature.<br />
And it doesn't want to be the one thing it must be.<br />
Not realizing that it's so much more than just an ape.<br /> 
Most people can't see.<br />
Most simply don't know enough of the truth.<br /> 
The facts: that they are energy made solid, consciousness and form, from a harmony of natural forces.<br />
We might possess the only eloquent eyes that will ever exist.<br />
We might be the universe's poetry.<br /> 
It's only chance to know itself.<br /> 
Ever!<br />
War!<br />
War has got monkey written all over it.<br /> 
Why do you bow to kings, and men with more expensive ties, and bigger cars.<br /> 
You think because you don't piss in the street that you're in control of your instincts.<br /> 
Wrong!<br />
We think it's our idea, that we decide what we will do, how we will react.<br /> 
But it's the feelings that Trevor gives us.<br /> 
The emotions, the envy, the anger, frustration.<br /> so many fears.<br /> 
This is how it gets us to do its bidding.<br /> 
It's the humans caged by the monkey this time.<br />
Yes, we kill, slaughter, murder, torture, exploit, steal.<br />
But don't you see.<br /> 
That's Trevor.<br />
That's what Trevor does.<br />
That's what Trevor does to us.<br /> 
That's what we're up against, the inner ape is our only enemy.<br /> 
Why do you think people will risk their marriages, their children, their family, everything they love, even their lives, for a piece of ass.<br /> 
"Well, what else is there?"<br />
What else is there, asks the man at the back.<br /> 
And, that's my point.<br /> 
<br />
That's, Trevor, talking.<br />
<br />
Fight your mind monkey!<br />
Take control.<br /> 
Reason against reflex.<br /> 
Instincts lose much of their power over you when you understand them.<br /> 
The only way to be at peace is to get to know your inner monkey.<br /> 
Train it!<br />
Train it, just like you train a real monkey.<br /> 
<br />
Most of all, show them love and beauty.<br /> 
But remember, it can only look where you look.<br /> 
They can only see, what you see.<br /> 
You must show them.<br /> 
You must look for the beauty.<br />

<h2 class="section-heading">falling&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 14, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Someone, maybe Einstein, once said that gravity is nothing more than a manifestation 
  due to everything falling towards something bigger.&nbsp; The whole space-time 
  distorted idea.&nbsp; It's a bit like this: put a bowling ball on a mattress, then roll another 
  ball towards it, that ball will <b>fall</b> into the bowling ball.&nbsp; It's not being 
  <b>pulled</b> by some force emanating from the bowling ball, rather it falls into it 
  due to a curvature (distortion) in the mattress.&nbsp; But most of us see gravity as something that 
  <b>pulls</b> things in and not as falling towards something.&nbsp; That's fine, but 
  then there are <b>magnets</b>.&nbsp; Ever play with those?&nbsp; Sure seems like 
  there's some <b>pulling</b> going on with those.&nbsp; Perception?&nbsp; Being human is so limiting.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">milestone&nbsp;<small>Wednesday, April 12, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today marks yet another of life's milestones.&nbsp; My official retirement.&nbsp; Well, at least 
  from the government's point of view, as shown by receiving my first social security check.&nbsp; 
  Can one really celebrate this moment?&nbsp; On the one hand, yes, I get back the money I paid 
  into it, but on the other hand I am now <b>officially old</b>.&nbsp; I guess a better question 
  is do I feel old?&nbsp; Somedays, yes, and somedays, no.&nbsp; Again, <b>change</b> is about 
  the only thing you can depend on.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">walking&nbsp;<small>Tuesday, April 11, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  In the year 2015 I walked over 3,500 miles.&nbsp; 
  Last year in 2016 I walked over 2,900 miles.&nbsp; That's more than the Appalachian Trail.&nbsp; 
  About 8 miles every day.&nbsp; At my age of 62, that's too much.&nbsp; So in 2017 I'm 
  going to decrease that to about 4 miles per day.&nbsp; About 10,000 steps, an hour 
  and a half or so of continuous walking.&nbsp; Yes, I walk slow.&nbsp;  Yes, I will have to eat less.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  This will free up some time so I can read, write, and do little chores around the house.
  <br />
  Or just sit on the porch, <b>do nothing</b>, and watch life go by.

<h2 class="section-heading">lazy day&nbsp;<small>Sunday, April 9, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Growing up christian means doing absolutely nothing on Sunday's.&nbsp; Maybe some family time.&nbsp; 
  For me it is no longer a religious thing.&nbsp; It's just socially acceptable, in america 
  anyways, to be lazy on this day.&nbsp; It's silly but nice.&nbsp; In the past few years, I 
  spend most Sunday's walking and reading which are two of my favorite things.&nbsp; 
  Unfortunately, I can remember a time when I worked every day of every week.&nbsp; Very exhausting.&nbsp; 
  However, I can remember a few times when I was unemployed and homeless--no food, no money.&nbsp; 
  So I've learned to go with the flow, and to live life a bit like air or water.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">feeling vs appearance&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 8, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  How do you feel right now, this very moment?&nbsp; For me, if I ignore the constant pain in my knee, middle 
  back(spine), and stomach I feel perfect.&nbsp; What if you look in a full length mirror?&nbsp; Now, how 
  do you feel?&nbsp; Yep, you're not as perfect as maybe you once were.&nbsp; The same goes for hopping on a 
  scale to check your weight, or feeling those bulges of fat you have here and there.&nbsp; But is appearance 
  anywhere near as important as how you actually feel?&nbsp; I guess it really boils down to desire.&nbsp; So 
  can you let go of your desires long enough to really feel?&nbsp; Try thinking and doing nothing for 
  some part of everyday.&nbsp; That can be difficult to do if you have family responsibilities, I know.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">trying to not think&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today is one of those days where I <b>do not want to think about anything</b>.&nbsp; 
  Have you ever tried to do that?&nbsp; 
  It is not easy to do.&nbsp; Many years ago when I ran six or more miles everyday, it was much easier to 
  reach a point where my mind would just get quiet.&nbsp; I don't know if that was because of all of 
  those chemicals released when a body is under stress.&nbsp; Meditation just never worked for me.&nbsp; 
  So now I'm stuck with just going for long walks, which only kind of quiets my mind but mostly I seem to 
  think about everything: past, present, and future.&nbsp; 
  Mind chatter is just a natural thing, like digesting food.&nbsp; 
  Sometimes it works to completely exhaust myself by not sleeping enough, and eventually it seems to catch 
  up with me and I completely pass out.&nbsp; 
  It is a healthy thing if you can stop thinking even for brief moments.&nbsp; 
  A friend had the idea that there should exist places, like beautiful parks or gardens, where one 
  can just go and <i>somehow</i> while you are in there you can't think about anything.&nbsp; 
  It's a great idea, but how to achieve that?&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">do it again&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  <i>Do it again</i> is something often said by children and implied by animals/pets.&nbsp; 
  And if you think about it, in a way, that simple phrase holds the meaning to why everything exists.&nbsp; 
  Could it be that what we call life and death is little more than the desire to <b>do it again</b>?&nbsp; 
  As in all over again, through fresh new eyes, so to speak.&nbsp; 
  To marvel at and play amongst everything that exists around us.&nbsp; To experience everything.&nbsp; 
  Yes, even pain and suffering, although I doubt anything that has feelings would ever say <i>do it again</i>.&nbsp; 
  But pain, suffering, and other unpleasant stuff are a part of existence and just another experience.&nbsp; 
  Don't get me wrong, as I am in no way belittling pain and suffering because I have struggled with both 
  of these for many years now.&nbsp; 
  Given my past, I also struggle with mental pain.&nbsp; Both together equal quite a bit of suffering.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">health &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 30, 2016</small></h2>
<p>
<span>
  The two biggest health problems are <b>chance</b> and <b>time</b>.&nbsp; 
  By <b>chance</b> I mean one may be predisposed to certain illnesses, it's just the
  luck (bad luck) of the draw.&nbsp; 
  By <b>time</b> I mean everything happens so slowly as to be almost imperceptable.&nbsp; 
  We suck at observing the small and slow changes that occur to our bodies.&nbsp; 
  We seem to only notice things just after they have happened -- like noticing you are 
  over 40 years old and suddenly you need reading glasses.&nbsp;  As a voracious reader 
  that was a bad day.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  It always seems to be a <b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
<span>Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.&nbsp; </span>
<span>After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.&nbsp; </span>
<span>You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>When it comes to calories, life is not fair.&nbsp; </span>
<span>
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting so much and focus on the quality of what you eat and eat less of it.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<p>
<span>Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.&nbsp; </span>
<br />
<span>There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.&nbsp; </span>
<span>For example <b>-- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts --</b> these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have a beer belly too.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<p>
<span>Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.&nbsp; </span>
<span>In fact, we do not need to eat any carbohydrates, but fruit is nice sometimes.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>
  Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.<br />
  <small>Hippocrates</small><br />
  <small>
    That's a nice quote, but don't forget that Hippocrates was a male in ancient Greece.<br />
    Which means he thought women were lesser humans, as in suffering from <b>hysteria</b> and 
    a <b>wandering uterus</b>.<br />
    And so, take his advice with a lot of salt.

</h3>
