At last, a rainy day. No walking today. Besides my feet are sore from all of the miles and miles.
They need a day off. Enjoy it. The rest of this week is dry and filled with miles.

We all know that marketing is lies. Anytime I return to watching cable tv, like a football game,
I am immediately reminded of this fact.
Marketing is loud and in your face -- thankfully there is a mute button.
Is this what we have become?
Well, it seems the answer is yes, at least in America --
where we no longer invent or make things any more -- we just market and talk, i.e. lie.
Sad.
</p>
<p>
A simple example is a so-called sports drink.
Look at the ingredients in Gatorade for example:
<ul>
<li>water -- that's good</li>
<li>sugar -- not good</li>
<li>high fructose corn syrup -- wtf? I think they removed this one</li>
<li>dextrose -- sugar by another name?</li>
<li>brominated vegetable oil -- again, wtf?</li>
<li>various gum's -- chewy?</li>
</ul>
... puddle water is better for you.
The lie in the marketing is that this drink helps your energy, hydration, and recovery.
Hello, it's sugar water with other crap in it.
Which is ok if you have the metabolism of a hummingbird.
If you want sugar water then put some sugar in your water -- and even better give
that to a hummingbird.
</p>

I will stick with water, an occassional coconut water, green tea, and coffee -- but mostly water.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Spiced Cluck Maybe</h2>
<p>
Food idea for today is chicken tenders.
No, not breaded and deep fried -- sounds good, but just stay healthy.
Let's grill them ... fire it up!
While the grill is heating up, slather chicken in olive oil, then sprinkle on some
basil, garlic/onion powder, salt, black pepper -- use your spice imagination here.
Grill each side for 4 minutes.
Do a double check, cut one open and check for pink. Pink bad, so grill more.
Maybe put them on a salad or just dive in with a fork.
Simple but oh so good ... please, no lip smacking, respect the chickens.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Healthy Pie Maybe</h2>
<p>
Writing and editing is an addiction -- it's worst with blogs and instant publishing.

Today's weather, ignoring the humidity, seems a prelude to
autumn and inevitably winter. I feel compelled to walk
more while I can. I do not look forward to winter and
that stationary bike -- as walking does not really seem
like exercising but more like a moving meditation. Especially after a year of walking 5+ miles
everyday. That's over 1,800 miles and about 360,000 calories burned,
but that does not mean very much as it is easy to eat 200 calories (about a mile).
For example, a small can of peanuts is well over 1,000 calories.

Perhaps someone can invent a tiny Raspberry Pi that we could
swallow, well, say in some raspberry pie. It could monitor our
overall health -- count calories in/out, real-time blood/urine work, etc.
-- then make recommendations and adjustments accordingly, such as:
<span class="caption text-muted">"go see the doc, dummy" or "no! you're not hungry" or "your pee smells bad"</span>
HealthyPi, swallow it today.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Eat Me Maybe</h2>
<p>
Despite all of the rain this morning and the oppressive humidity, I was still
able to get in 10,000+ steps today.
I just got the results of a blood test from the doctor yesterday.
The results were amazing. My A1C, triglycerides, etc. are all back to normal.
This has all changed since the way-over-the-top readings back in mid May 2015.
I really did not believe that the suggestions of the doctor and nutritionist would actually work.
I've always believed that you had to exercise to near exhaustion, i.e. nauseated, every
day to get and stay in shape -- I had that runner's mentality.
</p>
<p>
But their suggestions have worked with just walking and eating way more veggies every day.
Both the doctor and nutritionist seemed very surprised that I actually listened and followed
their advice. Apparently most people do not. While most people probably want
to feel better, they just don't or can't make it a habit for some reason. Hopefully,
I don't backslide, as they say, too much -- although pizza is seriously calling my
name especially on Fridays, and sometimes there's a ringing sound of tacos from Taco Bell,
or one of those huge burritos from Chipotle -- a 1,200+ calorie behemoth with 100+ carbs,
which should come with a side order of heart bypass surgery or a coffin.
</p>
<p>
Another new habit that has been key to losing weight and feeling better is counting calories.
I bought a cheap, small notebook and sharpie pen to keep in the kitchen near where I eat.
Don't bother counting the exact calorie intake, just round up. So each day I
have a record of what I ate and about how many calories consumed. I have tried to stay
within 1,400 to 1,800 each day. Some days I am more hungry than others. So far this has
worked great, as I have lost 1-2 pounds per week -- losing 70 pounds since
May 2015. Now, that is probably too much too fast, but I think it is typical to lose
more when first starting new diet and exercise habits. So I am prepared for this
to become more difficult and slower as time goes on. But there is simply no getting
around that calories consumed dictate your weight -- plain, simple, and true.
Because I have diabetes type 2, I do limit the carbs I eat per day. Also, buy some
dumbbells, like 10-15 pounds, and do some repetitions every other day. No, you
don't have to look like the Rock(Dwayne Johnson), but it will help with fat
burning as well being less flabby as you lose weight. Don't over do it with
the dumbbells, as a little goes a long way -- especially at first.
