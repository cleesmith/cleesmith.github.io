  During the following video, I just couldn't remember anything about

  despite using it for many years (old age?) -- click the link to read about it on wikipedia.&nbsp; 
  And here is part 2 of <b>striving to know your self</b> with more about <b>perception</b> and <b>interpretation</b>:

<br />
So I want to talk about perception and interpretation.
When I say perception, I mean human perception.
And one of my points here is that it's
limited to our five or six senses. Some
people don't believe in the sixth sense.
I do, but you know, if you talk to them
long enough you can probably convince them
there's a sixth sense. But anyway there's
the five: seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching.
<br /><br />
But I believe our sixth sense is a real thing.
There are two examples that everyone is familiar with:
intuition and being watched.
It's like you just kind of know something, and that has
nothing to do with learning, it's instinct, it's innate in some way.
I say feeling of being watched, but really it's a sense, same thing again I
think everybody's had that one where you feel
somebody staring at you or somebody's behind you.
I mean I've had crystal clear experiences of this while hiking on the Appalachian Trail.
I could since there were coyotes, could
tell they were watching and being 
super quiet, yet you can tell that they're lurking and up to something.
As well as black bears on several occasions.
One time there was a bear doing that
kind of back and forth thing they do, i.e. stalking.
So you do the thing where you make yourself bigger to scare them off.
But of course I was armed, so if he got too close then one of us or both were going to die.
I don't think black bears are like grizzly bears, where you have to shoot them 20 times
just to make him stop. He or she always ran away.
<br /><br />
After the six senses, which I believe in personally, I would add two more senses to that. 
But I'm not going to go into any details, because to be quite honest it would be too controversial. 
And you know in a way the seventh and eighth senses are beyond symbolism. 
In other words, I couldn't express them in language even if I wanted.
I see languages as you know symbolic of whatever.
<br /><br />
Human perception is physical of course except maybe the six sense, and then maybe it is and we just don't know how it's working. 
But there's a distinct physical aspect to those five senses we all agree exists.
Those get translated from out there to inside us, where it becomes chemical reactions.
Chemistry obviously indicates that we're limited.
There's a limitation there in terms of what can be experienced and perceived, unless you go get some advanced training.
Maybe you go to Tibet, I've been to Tibet.
I got close to climbing a mountain but did not. 
I would say, if I was just talking to somebody it was due to the weather, but truth of it is that several of us got really sick. 
And we weren't even up that high yet, so that's not a good sign.
And they really wouldn't let us go on, well, I guess they would have let us keep going. 
But there's been so many deaths over there due to idiots climbing when they shouldn't. 
So that's my thoughts on human perception.
<br /><br />
Now to talk about interpretation, which is a kind of a complicated thing to talk about.
Interpretation is complicated by your age and experiences.
I'm not tying age together with experiences, but I mean there are some limits there. 
If you're 19 obviously different things are going on
in your body that would influence how
you interpret things. 
Also the stuff that you've experienced throughout your life alters your interpretation of things. 
In my case, there was a lot of trauma during childhood.
So that really took a long time to get past. 
I wouldn't say it's gone but it was dealt with and is somewhat controllable. 
I mean you know things come and go in life. 
Also under interpretation I have that it can change in an instant and that's true.
Your awareness changes based on your interpretation of things. 
Changes are often influenced by sleep and dreams that we don't remember and that's true. 
That's apparently part of what we're doing when we sleep, is we're reviewing stuff and making interpretations and drawing conclusions and all kinds of stuff.
And that to me kind of ties back to interpretations can change in an instant, because of something that you may have come to while sleeping that you're not totally aware.
It's also difficult to control your interpretations, because there's always a little hint of uncertainty in there. 
Even though people shouldn't put things in little boxes like good bad, right wrong, none of that stuff, or good versus evil. 
Interpretation can be limited by the capabilities of our perceptions, I think I said that already.
I've had over the years several neighbors when I lived in apartments and townhouses that were blind and deaf. 
I derived a lot of insight from hanging around with them.
For a few years, there was a blind girl neighbor and we became close friends.
But she had a thing for being extremely vulgar.
I mean she had a thing for cussing, like she could probably make a sailor blush. 
She was something else, but I enjoyed being around her and we often talked about colors, light, and dark.
Her perspective was interesting.
Also, for a while I worked at a bowling alley. 
Not so much for the money, I think it's like 25 bucks an hour on the friday saturday sunday or something like that. 
I did it just to get time off from a situation i was currently experiencing and having to care for someone that was dying.
And sometimes that can be a bit much to deal with, so I worked there mainly for that reason.
There was a league of bowlers that couldn't speak or hear.
So I gave them a bit of special treatment by putting up their names and scores on the big screens using the computer.
They enjoyed it. But there was one girl that liked to argue with everyone.
We communicated using pen and paper.
And several times while bowling she would write "fuck you" in the notes we exchanged.
These are just simple examples of how your perception and interpretation can be influenced by your capabilities.
Interpretation can also be influenced by all of the input we are bombarded with every moment of every day.
Then we get caught up in that a little bit, where what we really should be doing is ignoring a lot of the 
coping methods that we use. 
And instead of always applying "know how" we should be doing "no how".
In other words, be open to receiving whatever without putting things into some predetermined box in your brain.
<br /><br />
So from the incense fog, I'll say peace and end it here.

<p>
  <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a> sure does make it easy to create 
  decent looking youtube thumbnail images, but the <i>free</i> background images are limited.&nbsp; 
  So I really want to paint my own version of a starry night with a person looking up.&nbsp; 
  Then use Canva just for the words, the text in the sky, because you can upload any image
  for the background.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  It does seem to be the case that youtube doesn't do subtitles for longer videos.&nbsp; 
  How long?&nbsp; I'm not sure, but this one is about 18 minutes and it got subtitles created.&nbsp;

  Yesterday I recorded a <b>twilight</b> video about getting to know your self.&nbsp; 
  My overly talkative and thoughtful time of day seems to be the dawn or sunset.&nbsp; 
  The video about being aware of our behavior in terms of four words or concepts: 
  <b>perception</b>, <b>interpretation</b>, <b>regurgitation</b>, and <b>deception</b>.&nbsp; 
  And how you may use those words as all of us <b>strive to know ourselves</b>.&nbsp; 
  Getting to truly know your self is one of the most important things you can do in life.&nbsp; 
  It doesn't matter if you do that using psychology, religion, witchcraft, meditation, or 
  spending time in nature.&nbsp; Just go observe animals, stare at dirt, or do absolutely 
  nothing at all and come to know your self.&nbsp; Spend some time with just you every day.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  After all, the only person you stand any chance of knowing is your self.&nbsp; Some say 
  they know their children.&nbsp; No you don't.&nbsp; Not even if you spent every moment 
  of every day with them.&nbsp; It's not like you can crack someone open and see 
  inside of them.&nbsp; Look at how often your children don't turn out like you 
  expected they would, and surprise you with their decisions.&nbsp;
