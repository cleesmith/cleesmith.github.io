<h2 class="section-heading">mandela effect&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 7, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Just watched the video 
  <a href="https://youtu.be/QgwQezM3MxI" target="_blank">Explaining the Mandela Effect (Prepare to have your brain scrambled!)</a> 
  by The Paranormal Scholar.&nbsp; As always her presentation is cool and interesting, but it did not scramble my brain.&nbsp; 
  Often it seems the obvious gets overlooked in things like this, which is the fact that people are involved.&nbsp; 
  In other words, the common bit is the human condition.&nbsp; So is it really all that surprising that similar 
  things happen to different people, afterall we are not that different from each other.&nbsp; My <b>I</b> and your 
  <b>I</b> are almost exactly the same.&nbsp; The skeptic flag is also raised by the appearance of any 
  reference to psychology--Carl Jung.&nbsp; Also, their website really sucks because WordPress sucks, pop ups that 
  force me to click suck!&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  The description for this video contains a much better motto for their channel:
  <i>Discussion is the lifeblood of understanding</i> than: 
  <i>The more you know, the more there is to fear</i>.&nbsp; 
  I know, way too much complaining.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">following&nbsp;<small>Friday, April 7, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  There's something about the word <b>following</b> that doesn't sit well with me.&nbsp; 
  Yet, I started following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheParanormalScholar" target="_blank">The Paranormal Scholar</a> 
  on YouTube.&nbsp; Mostly I watch their history documentaries and not the paranormal garbage.&nbsp; 
  I don't like their motto: <i>The more you know, the more there is to fear</i>.&nbsp; I get they are 
  just trying to increase subscribers/views by being dramatic.&nbsp; But that doesn't make any sense, as 
  who in their right mind would want more fear.&nbsp; Perhaps, they're targeting those into horror movies.&nbsp; 
  However, their history videos are well researched and lack the overly dramatic stuff.&nbsp; Of course, 
  this dichotemy between history and paranormal makes me doubt their content on the whole, but it's 
  just entertainment afterall.&nbsp; Their own conflict is apparent in the channel title: paranormal and scholar.&nbsp; 
  For learning about history I tend to view things like 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK_NHLbnG-k9a3-TQCeW1G3aTZLhxgvI8" target="_blank">The Other Side of History</a>, 
  of course this is just as limited by the known as anything else--i.e. just because it has a college professor that 
  is lecturing does not make it's content totally accurate.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  The reason I don't like the word <i>paranormal</i> is that I feel that anything we can experience 
  is actually <b>normal</b>.&nbsp; Isn't seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and feeling all normal things for
  people to do?&nbsp; Assuming one can do those things.&nbsp; The word <i>paranormal</i> just has too 
  many negative connotations, whether it deserves them or not.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">trying to not think&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Today is one of those days where I <b>do not want to think about anything</b>.&nbsp; 
  Have you ever tired to do that?&nbsp; 
  It is not easy to do.&nbsp; Many years ago when I ran six or miles everyday, it was much easier to 
  reach a point where my mind would just get quiet.&nbsp; I don't know if that was because of all of 
  those chemicals released when a body is under stress.&nbsp; Meditation just never worked for me.&nbsp; 
  So now I'm stuck with just going for long walks, which only kind of quiets my mind but mostly I seem to 
  think about everything: past, present, and future.&nbsp; Mind chatter is just a natural thing, like digesting food.&nbsp; 
  Sometimes it works to completely exhaust myself by not sleeping enough, and evetually it seems to catch 
  up with me and I completely pass out.&nbsp; It is a healthy thing if you can stop thinking even for brief moments.&nbsp; 
  A friend had the idea that there should exist places, like beautiful parks or gardens, where one 
  can just go and <i>somehow</i> while you are in there you can't think about anything.&nbsp; It's a great 
  idea, but how to achieve that <i>somehow</i> is the mystery.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">do it again&nbsp;<small>Thursday, April 6, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  <i>Do it again</i> is something often said by children and implied by animals/pets.&nbsp; 
  And if you think about it, in a way, that simple phrase holds the meaning to why everything exists.&nbsp; 
  Could it be that what we call life and death is little more than the desire to <b>do it again</b>?&nbsp; 
  As in all over again, through fresh new eyes, so to speak.&nbsp; 
  To marvel at and play amongst everything that exists around us.&nbsp; To experience everything.&nbsp; 
  Yes, even pain and suffering, although I doubt anything that has feelings would ever say <i>do it again</i>.&nbsp; 
  But pain, suffering, and other unpleasant stuff are a part of existence and just another experience.&nbsp; 
  Don't get me wrong, as I am in no way belittling pain and suffering because I have struggled with both 
  of these for many years now.&nbsp; Daily I struggle to cope with physical chronic knee, back, and stomach pain.&nbsp; 
  Given my past, I also struggle with mental pain.&nbsp; Both together equal quite a bit of suffering.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">over population&nbsp;<small>Tuesday, April 4, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I have heard the <b>everyone fits in Texas myth</b> repeated a lot 
  in blogs, NPR, and videos.&nbsp; In case you don't know, the Texas myth is that Earth is not 
  really over populated because everyone could fit in an area the size of the state of Texas.&nbsp; 
  Assuming we could tolerate being that close to each other, personally, I think we are too close 
  to each other as it is now.&nbsp; Here's an old school internet style web page that goes into further 
  <a href="http://ingles.homeunix.net/rants/density.html" target="_blank">details</a>.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  For those of us who love nature, it is frustrating to watch as planet Earth 
  is raped, pillaged, and plundered.&nbsp; Then again, the Earth was here before humans and 
  will be here long after we are gone.&nbsp; It survived the dinosaurs consuming everything 
  in sight, and will survive whatever we do as well.&nbsp; Yet, it's still frustrating and 
  sad to just standby and only watch it all go down the crapper.&nbsp; <b>Change</b> is the only 
  reliable thing, whether or not we think it's for the better or worse.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">rant about blogs&nbsp;<small>Saturday, April 1, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Why do people have text in their blogs that looks like it does in printed books?&nbsp;
  By that I mean why is the right hand margin all even and lined up ... it looks weird.&nbsp;
  Does anyone space out words to even up the right hand margin when they write by hand.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
  It just looks weird and unnatural.&nbsp; Yes, I get why they do it in books, to save on 
  the cost of paper.&nbsp; But it still looks weird and hyphenated words are annoying to read.&nbsp;
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">reading and writing &nbsp;<small>Thursday, March 30, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  I downloaded the PDF for this book:
  <br />
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thirty-Years-Among-Dead-Wickland-ebook/dp/B005HZK0D0/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=" target="_blank">
    Thirty Years Among the Dead
  </a> 
  &nbsp;<small>by Dr. Carl A. Wickland, M.D.</small>&nbsp;
  <br />
  The PDF is free if you google the title, not sure how amazon can get away charging $2 for it.&nbsp; 
  Also, I have spent some time rearranging and writing for this blog, of which I'm probably the only reader.&nbsp; 
  I did link to here from my youtube about page as well as instagram.&nbsp; And I did submit the URL 
  to google's search engine.&nbsp; Maybe it's just me but I find that when I read a lot I don't often 
  have much to write, other than boring daily life stuff -- which I already hand write in a journal.&nbsp; 
  This should not surprise me, after all, when is the last time I read anything that was 
  <i>earth shattering</i> or even all that profound about the human condition.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Been thinking about my feelings after visiting the 
  <a href="https://cleesmith.github.io/spirit.html" target="_blank">hospital</a> last night.&nbsp; Not 
  because I was ill or injured but it's something I do often.&nbsp; Hospitals are like revolving 
  doors to the land of the dead.&nbsp; I was going to type <i>escalator</i> but that connotes heaven, i.e. religion.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">retrieved from storage &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 29, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Since I completed working on a programming gig I started last month, I went and retrieved some 
  items from storage.&nbsp;   I like having empty rooms and closets in my house, so I pay to store things I 
  want to keep, you know, in those secure and climate controlled storage places.&nbsp;   I retrieved two boxes 
  of old journals (some are what I use to call "book of shadows"), a bunch of old books (to be reread and
  reviewed), some old t-shirts, candles, and art supplies I had forgot I bought.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Often when I am grieving over the loss of someone I become nostalgic and gather around me some old things.&nbsp; 
  Also, I tend to write and read even more than usual, which is normally a lot.&nbsp;   So I have started to focus on my 
  blog again and thinking about what direction my YouTube videos should take in the future.&nbsp;   I am considering 
  a new Google account to allow for a <i>pen name</i> and be more anonymous.&nbsp;   As we all know, the world is 
  filled with <i>whacko's</i> and <i>wing nut's</i> which are best kept as far away as possible.&nbsp; 
</p>
<hr />

<h2 class="section-heading">blogging, yet again &nbsp;<small>Monday, February 20, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
It has been a long time since I've updated this blog so here goes.&nbsp; 
Using github.&nbsp; io makes this blog cost nothing ($0) for anyone with a github account (also free).&nbsp; 
If you don't mind a domain name like <a href="https://cleesmith.github.io/" target="_blank">cleesmith.github.io</a> 
then it's totally free.&nbsp; 
One could also use a custom domain, as explained
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">rant about websites</h2>
<blockquote><b>It is so damn annoying!</b></blockquote>
<p>
  Why are there so many websites where the <b>meat</b> of the page is totally surrounded by ad's,
  tiny videos, <i>follow us</i>, and other annoying garbage?  I guess the "word" is
  not as powerful as we've been told.&nbsp; 
  We actually came to their page to read the article, and not to be bombarded by ad's, pop-up's, or whatever.&nbsp; 
  It gets worse as you scroll down while reading -- <b>pop up's</b> occur or videos start playing or
  the page refreshes parts of itself and becomes unresponsive.&nbsp; 
  My usual reaction is to immediately close the page.&nbsp;  Yes, I will not follow, nor like, nor participate 
  in such annoying nonsense -- usually the content on such websites is totally useless.&nbsp; 
  There should be a web browser setting that can only load the <b>readable text</b> on a page and nothing else.&nbsp; 
  You know, like the old days of the internet.&nbsp; 
  Ok, I found <a href="http://www.textise.net/" target="_blank">Textise</a> which is slow but makes annoying 
  websites more readable.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">health &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 30, 2016</small></h2>
<p>
<span>
  The two biggest health problems are <b>chance</b> and <b>time</b>.&nbsp; 
  By <b>chance</b> I mean one may be predisposed to certain illnesses, it's just the
  luck (bad luck) of the draw.&nbsp; 
  By <b>time</b> I mean everything happens so slowly as to be almost imperceptable.&nbsp; 
  We suck at observing the small and slow changes that occur to our bodies.&nbsp; 
  We seem to only notice things just after they have happened -- like noticing you are 
  over 40 years old and suddenly you need reading glasses.&nbsp;  As a voracious reader 
  that was a bad day.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  It always seems to be a <b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
<span>Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.&nbsp; </span>
<span>After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.&nbsp; </span>
<span>You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>When it comes to calories, life is not fair.&nbsp; </span>
<span>
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting so much and focus on the quality of what you eat and eat less of it.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<p>
<span>Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.&nbsp; </span>
<br />
<span>There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.&nbsp; </span>
<span>For example <b>-- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts --</b> these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have a beer belly too.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<p>
<span>Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.&nbsp; </span>
<span>In fact, we do not need to eat any carbohydrates, but fruit is nice sometimes.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.<br /><small>Hippocrates</small></h3><br />
