HAUNTED&#8200;STATUE? &mdash; This statue, marking the James Jeter family&rsquo;s plot in Cedar Hill Cemetery, is reported to be haunted. James Jeter came to Covington around 1892 to serve as a teacher and principal of the Covington School.
<br />
He later served as superintendent of Alleghany County and Clifton Forge schools. Jeter-Watson Intermediate School is named in his memory.

I can&rsquo;t say that I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts, because, frankly, I&rsquo;m not sure if I do or not. <br />I&rsquo;ve never seen one; but just because I&rsquo;ve never seen a ghost doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t exist, right?<br /><br />But there are some folks that really take this ghost-hunting stuff seriously. <br />They go to supposedly-haunted places, use high-tech gadgetry and doo-dads to try and pick up energy waves given off by those of the spirit variety and utilize the &ldquo;powers&rdquo; of those that claim to be one with the spirit world to talk with the long-since dead. <br />There&rsquo;s a whole slew of paranormal-related sites on the internet.<br /><br />Look them up sometime; they&rsquo;re kind of interesting.<br />That&rsquo;s all well and good, I guess, but I&rsquo;m just not into that stuff. <br />I can't see me strapping on one of those corny Ghostbusters backpacks and traipsing around at all hours of the night looking for evidence of paranormal activity; and, to be honest, most of those ghost-hunting adventures take place in the wee hours of a morning, and I&rsquo;m getting to the age that, unless my excitement is going to happen sometime before 9 o&rsquo;clock at night, I&rsquo;d just as soon be in bed reading.<br />That brings me to today&rsquo;s case. <br />I&rsquo;ll take one long-standing local urban legend and try to find out just where that legend comes from.<br />Did Annie Jeter die falling down the stairs on her wedding day, as the tale goes? <br />Does her statue in Cedar Hill Cemetery drip blood every Halloween?<br />Today, we&rsquo;ll look at the myths, we&rsquo;ll look at the facts and we&rsquo;ll see what exactly makes up this local legend.<br />So, sit back and relax, for today I&rsquo;ll try to expose the truth behind &ldquo;The Ghost of Mrs. Jeter.&rdquo;

I did something earlier this year that I&rsquo;ve never done before &mdash; I helped coach a Covington youth-league volleyball team. <br />I&rsquo;ve never coached anything of any kind before, unless you count a couple of church softball games years ago and we weren&rsquo;t very good, so I don&rsquo;t count that.<br />I&rsquo;m proud to report that my mouth only got me in trouble once, which resulted in Allen Dressler benching me for one night.<br />Those that know me know that&rsquo;s a victory in and of itself.<br />Anyway, one Saturday afternoon, as we were practicing in the Jeter-Watson Center gym (which, when I was in school, was called Jeter-Watson Middle School; it was used as a school until the new Jeter-Watson opened in 2009), one of my girls knocked the volleyball over my head and into the old girl&rsquo;s locker room.<br />I told her to go get it, as I was too lazy to go and do it myself. <br />&ldquo;Nuh uh,&rdquo; she proclaimed loudly while shaking her head. &ldquo;This place is haunted!&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; I asked.<br />&ldquo;This place is haunted,&rdquo; she said again, louder this time.<br />&ldquo;By whom,&rdquo; I asked.<br />&ldquo;By Mrs. Jeter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gotta be true because I read about it in the Jeter-Watson newspaper.&rdquo;<br />Keep in mind, this is an 11-year-old girl telling me this.<br />As I continued my query, I wasn&rsquo;t able to get the girl, who never did go in and get thae ball out of the locker room, to tell me who Mrs. Jeter was or why she would haunt an old school building.<br />In the end, The Wife went and got the ball for me, if my memory serves me correctly.<br />I knew from the basic histories of the area that The Boss (Horton) wrote through the years, the Jeter-Watson name came from the old Jeter School, which was located on Locust Street where the Mid-City Mall parking lot is today, and Watson High School, which served as the African-American high school until desegregation in the 1960s.<br />The Jeter School was&nbsp; built around 1917 or 1918 and was named after James Garrett Jeter, who was a teacher, principal and superintendent in Covington schools in the early part of the 20th Century. <br />It was torn down in 1969.<br />What is now known as the Jeter-Watson Center was originally built as a Works Progress Administration project between 1939 and 1940, at the same time the current Covington High School building on Lexington Avenue was built.<br />So I knew from the dates of when the building was built and the fact that I was pretty sure Mr. Jeter had gone on to The Great Whatever before the Watson building was built, I thought it quite impossible that his, I assumed, wife&rsquo;s spirit would be haunting it &mdash; especially not in the locker room, of all places. <br />Those locker rooms were absolutely gross when I was in school there 30 years ago and I doubt any self-respecting lady specter would be caught dead (no pun intended) in there now.<br />I first looked into who James Jeter was, and the information is really not that abundant. <br />He was born in Franklin County in 1860, came to Covington in about 1892 to become a teacher and principal at the Covington School, married a lady named Annie Maria in 1894 and became school superintendent for Alleghany County and Clifton Forge schools in 1910, retiring in July 1933.<br />For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Covington did not become a city until the 1950s. <br />Up until that time, schools in the town of Covington were partnered with those in Alleghany County, comprising one school division.<br />A consolidated school system?<br />But I digress.<br />Sadly, his Annie died in 1912 at the age of 48 and was buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery. <br />At some point along the way, a statue was placed in front of her grave and depicts a lady walking down a set of steps. <br />Here is where the facts begin turning into urban legend.<br />One of the folk tales behind the ghost of Mrs. Jeter is one where she falls down the steps on her wedding day, breaking her neck. <br />It is said the statue depicts poor Annie&rsquo;s last moments, just before she takes her final plunge.<br />That&rsquo;s a morbid sentiment to leave your loved one, if you ask me.<br />That&rsquo;s impossible, seeing as she had been married 18 years when she died and she and The Mister had three kids together &ndash; two sons and a daughter.<br />There&rsquo;s also an urban legend that the Jeter statue drips blood on Halloween night. <br />Just to see if that were true &ndash; and, yes I actually checked &ndash; I traveled to Cedar Hill last Halloween, about 8 o&rsquo;clock that night (so I could be home in bed by 9, remember) and can report that no blood was dripping from any of the Jeter statue appendages. <br />In looking at the haunting of the former Jeter-Watson Center, I find it highly illogical that she would have haunted that particular building, as she was long gone before it was even built. <br />I say that because, from my research into the paranormal, spirits tend to haunt places and people that have some individual significance to them &ndash; a former house, a jilted lover, you get the idea. <br />She had no connection to that building in life, so it&rsquo;s a far stretch for me to believe she stumbled upon it in death.<br />Also, spirits, seeing as spirits are supposedly composed of energy left behind when a living person travels on, the energy is drawn to the energy of those of the living. <br />It stands to reason that if Mrs. Jeter was, in fact, haunting the former Watson/Jeter-Watson building on Pine Street, she would have most likely moved on to the new Jeter-Watson school when the old building was closed down in 2009; and, to my knowledge, there&rsquo;s not been any strange goings-on over there during its short tenure, except for the way they teach math nowadays, which is another story for another day.<br />So how did the legend of Mrs. Jeter come about in the first place?<br />By their very nature, urban legends tend to take root in some kernel of&nbsp; truth. <br />In this case, Mrs. Jeter did die relatively young and there is a statue of a lady walking down the steps; but I think what&rsquo;s happened is, through the years, the legend of Mrs. Jeter has melded with the tragic tale of another of Cedar Hill&rsquo;s eternal residents, Martha Skeens Jordan.<br />&nbsp;Walk across the lane from the Jeter statue, head&nbsp; down toward Carpenter Drive and you&rsquo;ll find the Jordan family plot and one of the most unique tombstones I&rsquo;ve ever seen; and a bizarre story to go along with it.<br />It&rsquo;s shaped like a keyhole and is the stone for Martha and her infant daughter, Lucy Ira Jordan.<br />The story goes that Martha gave birth to Lucy on Nov. 9, 1847, but the baby died just two months later.<br />Gripped by grief, Martha died a month after Lucy, on Feb. 28, 1848. <br />Or so they thought.<br />About 40 years after her &ldquo;death,&rdquo; her body was exhumed, to be placed in a new coffin and interred in the Jordan family plot where she and Lucy now rest.<br />When the casket lid was opened, Martha was turned over on her face and her hand was up at her head.<br />For the mid-1800s, the notion of being buried alive was not out of the realm of possibility; heck, even today, most people will tell you that being buried alive is one of their biggest fears.<br />Mine&rsquo;s snakes, if you were wondering.<br />When Martha apparently died, her doctor naturally assumed she succumbed to apoplexy, which was kind of a catch-all diagnosis when a certain cause could not be found right away.<br />Knowing both Annie Jeter&rsquo;s story, and knowing Martha Jordan&rsquo;s tragic outcome, it&rsquo;s really not too far-fetched to think their stories might collide into one juicy urban legend.<br />My only foray into a study of the supernatural at Cedar Hill began almost two years ago, shortly after my daughter was buried there.<br />It never happened when I was there before her death, but now everytime I make my daily visit to Babygirl&rsquo;s grave, my fire department-issued pager goes nuts. <br />Usually, it only does that when I&rsquo;m around powerful electronics. <br />It goes buck-wild, for instance, when I go into Food Lion.<br />But there&rsquo;s no electronic devices anywhere close to her grave at Cedar Hill.<br />Hmm. <br />Think about that one.<br />Cedar Hill isn&rsquo;t the only final resting place in the Alleghany Highlands that is noted for things that go bump in the night.<br />Take the Mallow Family cemetery over in Jackson Heights.<br />There&rsquo;s an urban legend that I recently came across that says if you go to the old graveyard at 2:30 in the morning (what an ungodly hour) and wait, a man will appear out of nowhere and start smoking a cigarette.<br />The tale goes that he&rsquo;ll walk up to you and stare menacingly at you with evil eyes.<br />Unlike most ghosts, this one even talks to you.<br />I can&rsquo;t tell the rest of it&nbsp; as poetically like the person I got it from, so I&rsquo;ll let her report what happened next &mdash;&nbsp; &ldquo;If you want a real good scare, go to this old graveyard over here in Jackson Heights. But when I was looking into his eyes, I swear all you could feel is like full evil was around you, and it felt like you were trying to be pulled into the Earth. I was too scared to even say anything. He was even talking to me, too. I remember because he even asked me if I was scared of him and when I replied back, that&rsquo;s when he said I should be. And I&rsquo;m not lying, neither. But we really don&rsquo;t like talking about it, though, or to be asked about it.&rdquo;<br />Take that legend for what it&rsquo;s worth, but I don&rsquo;t ever recall my friends Bob and Janet Baker telling me they smoked a stogie with any spectral neighbors before.<br />I&rsquo;ll have to ask them sometime.<br />I guess I&rsquo;ll never get to experience that one, unless he wants to come by the house about 7 or 8 o&rsquo;clock. <br />I never turn down the chance to have a good smoke.<br />Next time, In the Spotlight we&rsquo;ll take a look at some local heroes that will make G.I. Joe look like a corny action figure.<br />Until next time, folks&hellip;<br />
