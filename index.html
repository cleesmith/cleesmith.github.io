<h2 class="section-heading">retrieved from storage &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 29, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
  Since I completed working on a programming gig I started last month, I went and retrieved some 
  items from storage.&nbsp;   I like having empty rooms and closets in my house, so I pay to store things I 
  want to keep, you know, in those secure and climate controlled storage places.&nbsp;   I retrieved two boxes 
  of old journals (some are what I use to call "book of shadows"), a bunch of old books (to be reread and
  reviewed), some old t-shirts, candles, and art supplies I had forgot I bought.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>
  Often when I am grieving over the loss of someone I become nostalgic and gather around me some old things.&nbsp; 
  Also, I tend to write and read even more than usual, which is normally a lot.&nbsp;   So I have started to focus on my 
  blog again and thinking about what direction my YouTube videos should take in the future.&nbsp;   I am considering 
  a new Google account to allow for a <i>pen name</i> and be more anonymous.&nbsp;   As we all know, the world is 
  filled with <i>whacko's</i> and <i>wing nut's</i> which are best kept as far away as possible.&nbsp; 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">blogging, yet again &nbsp;<small>Monday, February 20, 2017</small></h2>
<p>
It has been a long time since I've updated this blog so here goes.&nbsp; 
Using github.&nbsp; io makes this blog cost nothing ($0) for anyone with a github account (also free).&nbsp; 
If you don't mind a domain name like <a href="https://cleesmith.github.io/" target="_blank">cleesmith.github.io</a> 
then it's totally free.&nbsp; 
One could also use a custom domain, as explained
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">rant about websites</h2>
<blockquote><b>It is so damn annoying!</b></blockquote>
<p>
  Why are there so many websites where the <b>meat</b> of the page is totally surrounded by ad's,
  tiny videos, <i>follow us</i>, and other annoying garbage?  I guess the "word" is
  not as powerful as we've been told.&nbsp; 
  We actually came to their page to read the article, and not to be bombarded by ad's, pop-up's, or whatever.&nbsp; 
  It gets worse as you scroll down while reading -- <b>pop up's</b> occur or videos start playing or
  the page refreshes parts of itself and becomes unresponsive.&nbsp; 
  My usual reaction is to immediately close the page.&nbsp;  Yes, I will not follow, nor like, nor participate 
  in such annoying nonsense -- usually the content on such websites is totally useless.&nbsp; 
  There should be a web browser setting that can only load the <b>readable text</b> on a page and nothing else.&nbsp; 
  You know, like the old days of the internet.&nbsp; 
  Ok, I found <a href="http://www.textise.net/" target="_blank">Textise</a> which is slow but makes annoying 
  websites more readable.&nbsp;

<h2 class="section-heading">health &nbsp;<small>Wednesday, March 30, 2016</small></h2>
<p>
<span>
  The two biggest health problems are <b>chance</b> and <b>time</b>.&nbsp; 
  By <b>chance</b> I mean one may be predisposed to certain illnesses, it's just the
  luck (bad luck) of the draw.&nbsp; 
  By <b>time</b> I mean everything happens so slowly as to be almost imperceptable.&nbsp; 
  We suck at observing the small and slow changes that occur to our bodies.&nbsp; 
  We seem to only notice things just after they have happened -- like noticing you are 
  over 40 years old and suddenly you need reading glasses.&nbsp;  As a voracious reader 
  that was a bad day.&nbsp; 
  <br />
  It always seems to be a <b>sudden</b> instead of a <b>gradual</b> event.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>Eating always beats Exercising</h3>
<p>
<span>Never forget that you can <b>not</b> out exercise what you eat.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Well, you can, if you try hard enough, but you will die trying.&nbsp; </span>
<span>After all, a handful of nuts (about 15) is the equivalent of running a mile or walking two miles.&nbsp; </span>
<span>You can literally chew and swallow 15 nuts in a few seconds, but you will be walking that off for 45 minutes.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>When it comes to calories, life is not fair.&nbsp; </span>
<span>
  Unless you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">math jones</a>,
  stop counting so much and focus on the quality of what you eat and eat less of it.&nbsp; 
</span>
</p>

<h3>Never turn to the dark side</h3>
<p>
<span>Do not eat food that's comes in a bag, box, or can -- most of it is not really food.&nbsp; </span>
<br />
<span>There's probably a good, as in bad, reason it is stored in the dark.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>If it grew under ground (dark) then there are way too many carbs in it, so don't eat it.&nbsp; </span>
<span>For example <b>-- carrots, potatoes, and peanuts --</b> these are roots and one of their main
  purpose is to be a dense energy store for plants.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Roots are the beer belly of a plant, and if you eat too many you will have a beer belly too.&nbsp; </span>
</p>

<h3>Respect yourself</h3>
<p>
<span>Eating more than 30 grams of carbohydrates is not necessary.&nbsp; </span>
<span>In fact, we do not need to eat any carbohydrates, but fruit is nice sometimes.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Our bodies make more than enough sugars (carbs) already, often times, too much.&nbsp; </span>
<br /><br />
<span>Treat food like an intimate relationship, and don't just allow anything inside of you.&nbsp; </span>
<span>Respect your mouth as much as your other orifices.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
