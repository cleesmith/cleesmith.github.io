do you have a wiki name that how did you come by it
where are you located what brought you to that area or were you born there 
do you wear a special a note or jewelry for spell work 
what's your favorite space or place 
what's your favorite stone or crystal for magical working
how long have you been practicing and how did you come to this path
do you have a deity god or goddess and how did you connect with them
what's your favorite incense or smudge
have you ever had a clear space of a negative entity

I'm not
going to entity no but a negative energy
yes I think I've also told a little bit
about this but I have a family member
who is just very negative it's just like
it's not necessarily that she's always
liked trying to be negative but just her
persona just it's like she exudes a
negative energy it's just like how she
is I don't know she's unhappy if she's
just unhappy with herself with the world
with what but it's like you know those
people who are just like upbeat and
peppy and didn't fit and healthy all the
time
it's sort of like that but she's just
negative just because a zoo is the
energy and because I'm an impact it's
like I soaked it up and like she can
leave the house be gone you know and I
just it's like I can feel it I can feel
it in the house and I don't have a
choice but to live with her because of
my situation with the chronic illness
and not being able to have a job and
having someone has to be take care of me
and just all this just a big situation
that I can't control the end so I don't
have a choice but i don't really have
much much of a choice there but anyway
so yes I do have to clear the space
occasionally so what's your favorite
Richie show a movie I really like Harry
Potter and I really like that movie the
skeleton key I really like that one and
then these next 2 i'm not exactly sure
they're not like super wiki but they are
a little bit I like Buffy and the show
once upon a time i don't i don't know
some people might sort of consider those
which you some people might not I don't
know depends on your view I guess what
do you do to help raise energy before
spell work i cloned myself and put on
music I like music do you see yourself
helping others magically sometimes I
think I would really like to I think
it's amazing to like open up a shop and
sell like candles and soaps and bath
products and incense and herbs and you
know oils and all kind of stuff that I
make and then also bring in like other
products that may be other people have
made or that are just kind of like to
send a candle stuff it's sort of like I
don't want to say generic but like you
know that's just kind of like popular
the kind of a lot of people use but then
like my kind of rational side kicks in
to me like this never going to happen
you know like with your illness and the
fact that like it takes like a bunch of
energy just to like make a youtube video
like if you can't even like do that and
you can't even like hold down a job and
you're like at a pain level is like an 8
out of 10 on a good day yeah then ain't
never going to happen what is your
preferred form of divination sorry to be
such a downer probably just being honest
what is your preferred form of
divination I like pendulums although i
don't do divination a whole lot yeah i
don't know i just don't do definition of
a lot i don't feel it's really necessary
but i do like pendulums i'd like to be
done to tarot card but they're just
they're real hard to learn for me what
element do you work with most when I
read this question my automatic answer
was fire because I used candles but then
when I thought about it more I was like
holy maybe it's actually earth because I
used crystals and I use herbs that I
grow in my garden plus herbs that I by
so maybe it's actually earth or maybe
they're sort of fire and Earth are sort
of about equal I'm not sure so I really
enjoy working in my garden I don't have
a garden ghia around because during the
winter it does not really much you can
grow although it doesn't get super cold
here in Texas but still I mean it is
cold enough that you can't really grow
much but during the spring and summer
and stuff I do grow a garden and I've
got one starting now and I love growing
stuff it's it's a lot of fun and I love
being able to use it in my kitchen
witchery and in like my I make like oils
and stuff for my bath products and I
find fusing um you know and then I use
them and just kind of like regular like
regular diploid tree oh I know you do
that one if you throw a party which
other YouTube which is would you invite
kind of a weird question but um I guess
pretty much everyone except the drama
llamas
what are yer what she calls from a new
year new Year's already started because
this was started a few months back but I
think basically to try to deepen my
spirituality cuz last few months or so I
guess two or three months I've been on
kind of a slump I just haven't felt good
and I'm it felt like really doing
anything witchy and I don't cast spells
a lot because I believe they should be
kind of a last resort but I haven't
really been just connecting with my
spirituality or really doing a whole lot
and I also like to start getting to work
on my working book of shadows and
getting a bunch of information together
and working on that which is going to
slow process but I'd like to start
getting all the information together and
putting it in my works and book of
shadows and then maybe by the time
Dexter comes around I'll be able to work
on my final book shows so yeah that was
question 16 and I hope you all enjoyed
