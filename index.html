<h2 class="section-heading">More Readable Maybe</h2>
<p>
I finally spent some time trying to make this blog more readable and more mobile friendly.
I chose a Bootstrap based setup called <a href="http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/" target="_blank">Clean Blog</a>,
but made a few changes. Mostly I changed it to be less focused on images. It seems to work ok so far, and
it is a bit more search engine friendly. It is also easier to edit using the simple idea of headers and paragraphs.
<span class="caption text-muted">I am slowly editing and adding content from the original blog.</span>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Fallacies</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Knobs and whistles
    <span class="caption text-muted">they find no value in actually solving a problem, rather they have an over fascination with tech</span>
  </li>
  <li>Boil the ocean
    <span class="caption text-muted">they have great ambition, but no real planning and just a desire to be the next <i>Uber whatever</i></span>
  </li>
  <li>Entourage
    <span class="caption text-muted">they are not forming a team of collaborators but just trying to attract <b>hangers on</b> -- "listen to me</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Or more simply put <b>snake oil</b> developers and projects.</blockquote>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">An Obsession Maybe</h2>
<p>
I think I am obsessed with throttling and rate-limiting code. There is a lot of
this for C/C++, but with Go there seems to be even more. I spend hours tinkering
with it.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Lazy Good Maybe</h2>
<p>
Someone once said that good programmers are naturally lazy. Well, I think I qualify after wrestling
with the seo tool Enseomble. It turns out it was totally unnecessary. After re-coding the
tool to use SharedCount and asking a friend to give it try, their response was that
they currently do all of that with a product called <a href="https://www.blockspring.com/" target="_blank">Blockspring</a> as a plug-in for Excel.
So I researched this a bit more and found that Blockspring also works as an
add-on in Google Spreadsheets.
And it is really easy to use. The exact same social counts are displayed as before but without any
coding. It is just a matter of using the correct cell formulas, or blocks as blockspring calls them.
But wait, it gets cooler. One can code your own blocks -- i.e. custom functions for use with
either Excel or Google Spreadsheets -- and in your choice of language:
Python, Ruby, R, PHP, NodeJS, Javascript, and others. So whatever you can code and do in a
standalone or web app you can do in blockspring. The user never has to leave the spreadsheet
nor have a programmer write a custom program to gather data.
<br>
Blocks/formulas have already been written for:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sharedcount.com/" target="_blank">SharedCount</a></li>
<li><a href="https://moz.com/" target="_blank">Moz</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.semrush.com/" target="_blank">SEMrush</a></li>
<li>HTML content extractors</li>
<li>Keyword analysis: mostly SEMrush and <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/" target="_blank">Alchemy API</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">SEO</h2>
<p>
Personally I do not work in marketing, seo, site promoting, or whatever it's called, I write software.
But some of my family and friends do work in marketing and seo. They have tried on several occassions to
code, in python, their own tools to help with gathering data. Sometimes with success but most often
they contact me to improve or re-code their tools. So over the years I have picked up quite a bit
of knowledge regarding marketing and seo -- well, I don't have any <i>secret knowledge, skills, or weapons</i>.
But it has been interesting.
<br>
Here is a list of the tools commonly used:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/" target="_blank">Screaming Frog</a> -- free for 500 URI crawls</li>
<li><a href="https://www.seopowersuite.com/" target="_blank">SEO PowerSuite</a></li>
<li>Excel -- of course, who doesn't use this for everything</li>
</ul>

So with all of the above in mind, I do not think that <a href="https://github.com/cleesmith/enseomble" target="_blank">Enseomble</a> should reinvent software which
already exists and does a great job. Also, it is important to remember that all of the data gathered
is useless without someone organizing and analyzing it. So this type of work really boils
down to people using spreadsheets in an intelligent way to offer their clients a beneficial
service.
<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9JK8W32Ss" target="_blank">Here is a general video of someone doing this.</a>
<br><br>
Enseomble should NOT:
<ul>
<li>crawl/spider web sites -- Screaming Frog does this and is free</li>
<li>
  scrape html content:
  <br>
  title, meta description, meta keywords(now ignored by google anyways), headings, etc.
  <span class="caption text-muted">Screaming Frog does all of this and it is free.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Enseomble should:
<ul>
<li>gather social media counts as best it can using SharedCount</li>
<li>assist with keywords and search rankings (SERPs) -- maybe ?</li>
<li>create a xlsx file for use with Excel or Google Spreadsheets</li>
<li>be as fast as possible given the expected throttling by api providers</li>
<li>be simple to use</li>
<li>run anywhere with no installation or dependencies</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You might be thinking well I want something that does everything all at once and in a
single software package. That sounds great, maybe someday, but for now I think the
unifying piece is the spreadsheet. This allows someone doing seo work to copy, cut, paste,
import, and export data as they see fit. And if the tools they need to gather that data
run anywhere then they are free to focus on using spreadsheets for analysis.
</p>
<p>
While it is all well and good that things like pipulate aim to both teach python (albeit poorly)
and be an seo tool, but these two things are at cross purposes. The situation has yielded a
tool that is cumbersome to use and difficult to learn anything from that is valuable to anyone.
